29,These emerging markets are fertile ground for creativity and innovation.,2010
30,However in South Africa competitiveness is being eroded by poor productivity and a labour market dominated by unions that have strong political influence.,2010
31,"An additional problem is that South Africa's exports are largely minerals and other commodities, now 62% of total exports, up from 46% in 2002 (source: BCA Research).",2010
32,"Profit margins on commodities are at the bottom end of the 'food chain', whereas beneficiation, and gaining branded status, immediately raises profit margins.",2010

59,"""This information should help make business leaders understand that reputation is especially important when it comes to ethics and sustainability,"" said Antoine Mach, Covalence EthicalQuote's managing partner and cofounder.",2013
60,"""As real sustainability performance is very difficult to measure in a standard, objective way, reputation is a proxy of such performance.",2013
61,"Also, reputation is a vector of the return on investment of sustainability programs: Doing green things is good in itself, but if the company's stakeholders aren't aware of such good things, they won't reward the company, which itself won't be motivated to do more.""",2013
62,"From Google's news dominance to the automobile industry's steady rise in favorability, here are some of EthicalQuote's key findings from January through November of 2013 — and what you can learn from the results.",2013
63,"Buzz-worthy companies

The 20 companies below garnered the greatest number of headlines pertaining to sustainability and ethics in the 2013 assessment.",2013
64,"For those that earned mostly positive headlines, making this list is good news; for those often called out for malfeasance, it can be a wake-up call for change.",2013
65,"While Covalence didn't specifically differentiate between positive and negative coverage, it's not hard to draw a qualitative line in the sand.",2013
66,"The leader, Google, for example, had a banner year in sustainability.",2013
67,"In 2013, it launched ambitious solar initiatives, jumped on the sustainability crowdsourcing bandwagon and joined forces with the likes of Al Gore to explore the greening of the Internet.",2013
68,"Ditto tech giant Facebook, which nabbed headlines for several data center-related initiatives, and Microsoft, which made significant strides in the areas of carbon pricing and offsets as well as energy-efficient buildings.",2013
69,"(That said, not all coverage related to these companies was favorable.",2013
70,"Both Facebook and Google, for instance, came under fire for problematic relationships with climate change deniers.)",2013
71,"On the flipside, a handful of companies on the list garnered headlines with a more critical edge.",2013
72,"Chevron, for example, made the news when shareholders pressured it to be more transparent about climate risks.",2013
73,"Others received more divided coverage, such as Bank of America, commended for a U.K. effort to cut down on waste but also criticized for supporting coal.",2013
74,Perhaps the most interesting entry on the list is Wal-Mart.,2013
75,"It has not traditionally been thought of as a green leader, but it made notable and bold advances this year, ranging from introducing safer chemicals in products to leading the carbon pricing charge — proving that it's never too late to shift focus and public image.",2013
76,"Industries rising, industries falling

The index's analysis of industries yielded similarly telling findings.",2013
77,"In this case, Covalence did factor in positive and negative qualifications, using a naïve Bayesian classifier trained on 12 years of human-coded data, as well as human analysts to verify the sentiments.",2013
78,"The heat map below reveals the industries with mostly positive (greens) and negative (reds and pinks) media traction in 2013:

(The size of boxes represents the volume of information.",2013
79,"The color indicates the ratio of positive news / total news from 0 to 100 percent)

This data emphasizes the importance of industry-wide communication efforts based on clear reporting and metrics.",2013
80,"""It's surprising to see the automobile industry is leading the ranking, while energy is last — after all, most cars still rely on oil,"" noted Mach.",2013
81,"""The difference is that automobile companies communicate a lot about greener cars, while the energy sector has difficulties showing its positive impacts.""",2013
82,"Indeed, the automotive industry has done an exemplary job of communicating sustainability efforts to the public, particularly regarding the rise of electric and alt-fuel vehicles.",2013
83,"Conversely, energy companies have struggled to distance themselves from negative news events such as oil spills.",2013
84,"Banking, another sector often perceived negatively, similarly has floundered in its reputation-brandishing efforts.",2013
85,"""Automobile companies can improve products (greener cars make the news), as can F&B companies (which can tout, for example, less salt, sugar and fat or the responsible sourcing of raw materials),"" Mach said.",2013
86,"""But banks don't communicate a lot about their sustainable products, while facing many controversies.""",2013
87,"Interestingly, the Automobiles & Components and Food, Beverage & Tobacco sectors — already the most favorably viewed in 2009 — also have experienced steady upticks in favorability over time.",2013
88,"On the other hand, the Energy and Banks sectors — already low on the list — have slipped precipitously, as the chart below shows.",2013
89,"Surprises, takeaways and what's ahead

According to Mach, positive news about sustainability has been on an upswing.",2013
90,"""In a historical perspective, quantities of positive news increase month after month — there doesn't seem to be sustainability fatigue on the positive side,"" she said.",2013
91,"Negative coverage, though, also has amped up — although Mach says this too can be seen as a progressive development.",2013
92,"""Over the last two years, there has been a sensible growth of negative comments in ESG-related news: more and more controversies, affairs and scandals are making noise,"" she said.",2013
93,"""It may be that governments have adopted stronger regulations and are now punishing faulty companies more strongly (see recent fines relating to the Libor scandal).",2013
94,"It seems societies are becoming less tolerant of business malpractices, perhaps in response to the 2007-2008 financial crisis.""",2013
95,"For companies with positive news to share, the imperative is clear: It's time to grab the megaphone.",2013
96,"""Companies doing green/sustainable things should communicate about it and find external relays, so that stakeholders, the media and the public are aware of it and have an improved perception of them,"" Mach said.",2013
97,"""This will then be rewarded through better relations with customers, consumers, regulators, investors, employees and future employees, as well as communities.""",2013

106,"In this post, we will explore how storage is changing inside your datacenter, and how we transform industry standard disks into reliable, high-performance onsite storage for you datacenter.",2013
107,A common model today is for new deployments of important workloads like virtualization and line of business applications to utilize a storage-area network (SAN) to achieve the performance and reliability the workload needs.,2013
108,"In this model, the virtual machines running on the physical hosts access virtualized volumes of storage over the network.",2013
109,"These volumes are provided by the SAN, which contains a set of physical disks, some hardware, and software that work together to provide performance, reliability, and a level of storage virtualization.",2013
110,"If you have a significant investment in a SAN infrastructure, you can rest assured Microsoft is continuing to integrate key technologies into products like Windows Server to keep it the best operating system to use with SANs.",2013

112,We also have TRIM/UNMAP support for thin provisioning and flexible and efficient storage utilization.,2013
113,But there are other options.,2013
114,Historically Windows Server file-based storage was a great option for user data – workloads like file servers and SharePoint.,2013
115,"But starting with Windows Server 2012, we dramatically improved the performance and reliability of the file server, enabling it to serve as a direct replacement for more traditional storage options.",2013
116,"In this model, the Windows Server cluster contains the disks, hardware, and software to provide high-performance, reliable virtualized storage volumes over the network.",2013
117,"Storage Spaces, introduced in Windows Server 2012, aggregates the physical disks into these virtual volumes.",2013
118,"The performance needed for this solution is delivered by a host of features – including improvements in the SMB protocol, such as SMB Direct and SMB Multichannel which make use of multiple network connections and RDMA.",2013
119,Performance is further enhanced with Windows Server 2012 R2 which adds storage tiering capabilities to Storage Spaces.,2013
120,"SSDs and spinning disks can both be part of the virtualized volumes, and Windows Server automatically stores the more frequently accessed data on the faster physical storage for dramatically higher total performance.",2013
121,You can read more about the storage performance of Windows Server 2012 in an ESG Lab report.,2013
122,"An additional upcoming report includes additional performance validation, such as the table below, which compares 2, 4, 6, and 8 VM SQL workload transactions per second across various storage architectures.",2013
123,Windows Server 2012 also improved the reliability of File and Storage Services clusters.,2013
124,Such clusters no longer suffer the brief downtime previously associated with failover scenarios.,2013
125,"Instead, the failure of one node is detected immediately, and service is provided by another cluster node so quickly, the virtualization hosts are not disrupted – they retain access to storage.",2013
126,The benefits of such a solution are clear.,2013
127,"While it’s always been possible to achieve high levels of performance and reliability, in the past, this required higher costs and proprietary storage management solutions.",2013

141,This was a serious limitation in Hyper-V and a roadblock for converting certain physical servers to Hyper-V.,2013
142,The VHD format had been around since Microsoft Corp. bought Connectix Corp. and VHD was used with Microsoft Virtual Server.,2013
143,"A VHD (or VHDX) contains everything an operating system (OS) needs to store its data, including a disk partition and file system such as NTFS or FAT.",2013
144,"For every virtual machine (VM) created, there's a virtual disk where the OS, applications and data for that VM reside.",2013
145,"Of course, you can add multiple VHD or VHDX files to a VM.",2013
146,What does VHDX offer?,2013
147,The new VHDX format allows a virtual machine disk file to scale up to 64 TB in size.,2013
148,"This is just what large VMs -- such as database servers, file servers, Exchange mailbox servers and more -- needed to be converted into the virtual infrastructure.",2013
149,"Besides the greater scalability of VHDX, it has additional resiliency.",2013
150,The VHDX format offers protection against data corruption when events such as power failures unexpectedly take down the Hyper-V host.,2013
151,Resiliency is possible by logging updates to the VHDX in the VHDX metadata such that those logged updates can be played back to recover the VHDX with integrity after the Hyper-V host is powered back on.,2013

774,"According to web analytics company StatCounter, Windows 10 in January captured 42.78 percent of the desktop market share worldwide followed closely by longtime favorite Windows 7 at 41.86 percent.",2018
775,"Windows 8.1, meanwhile, wasn't even close with an overall share of just 8.72 percent.",2018
776,"Windows 10 launched on July 29, 2015, and managed to quickly capture a sizable share of the market thanks to Microsoft's free upgrade offer.",2018
777,"That said, Redmond was a bit too ambitious with its goal of hitting one billion Windows 10 installations just three years after launch, scrapping those plans in 2016.",2018
778,"Windows 7 continues to have a loyal following, especially among business users.",2018
779,"With any luck, Microsoft will phase out Windows 7 faster than it did XP.",2018

807,Microsoft Windows Server 2016 includes new features that allow IT departments to set up a software-defined hyper-converged infrastructure.,2018
808,Microsoft provides several options for managing a hyper-converged infrastructure environment for IT administrators that choose the HCI path via a Windows Server deployment.,2018
809,"For example, admins can use PowerShell to deploy and maintain the HCI components.",2018
810,This includes the PowerShell Desired State Configuration management platform built into Windows.,2018
811,"Other options include System Center Virtual Machine Manager, which is part of the System Center suite, and Microsoft Project Honolulu, a browser-based management tool that can be deployed on premises.",2018
812,"IT teams implementing HCI in a Windows Server deployment can also deploy guarded fabrics and shielded virtual machines (VMs) to protect workloads against theft, inspection, tampering and other risks.",2018
813,"These features rely on the Host Guardian Service (HGS), a server role that ensures Hyper-V hosts are known entities and running trusted software.",2018
814,"When configuring HGS, administrators must choose from one of two attestation modes: Active Directory-based and Trusted Platform Module-based, which has far more rigorous requirements.",2018
815,"When configuring Storage Spaces Direct in a Windows Server deployment, administrators should create volumes for holding workload files, including the VHD or VHDX files used for the VMs.",2018
816,The volumes provide the structure necessary to support fault tolerance and scalability.,2018
817,Microsoft recommends administrators use the Resilient File System for the volumes because it can help accelerate performance and protect against data corruption.,2018
818,Project Honolulu consolidates administrative-based applications into a single web-based interface.,2018
819,"Network Controller is at the heart of the software-defined networking (SDN) system in Windows Server and provides a centralized interface for configuring, managing and monitoring physical and virtual network resources.",2018
820,Network Controller also allows IT teams to automate network-related administrative tasks.,2018
821,Administrators can also implement one of the many other SDN features available in a Windows Server deployment.,2018
822,"For example, they can use Datacenter Firewall to apply firewall policies to virtual networks, or they can implement Software Load Balancing to achieve higher availability and scalability.",2018
823,Windows and Linux-based servers work side by side in the corporate data center.,2018
824,But which is the best server OS for your changing workloads?,2018
825,"For an effective evaluation of a Linux server vs. a Windows Server, you must look at their functionality, hardware requirements, stability, cloud readiness, security, cost and support options.",2018
826,You must also consider workload: Do you need a cloud-ready OS or does the application have specific hardware requirements?,2018
827,"Windows isn't going away any time soon, particularly as a corporate authentication and authorization offering.",2018
828,"But as applications move more toward cloud architectures, Windows servers are making way for Linux .",2018
829,"Historically, organizations have deployed Linux servers for the tasks Linux does well, such as database management, web server management and customer relationship management.",2018
830,"Microsoft, on the other hand, markets Windows Server as an all-in-one OS that's easy to manage and requires less training to use.",2018
831,"But Linux also works well as a multipurpose OS, so it's important to know which OS best fits your server needs.",2018
832,"Best server OS stability Linux has a reputation for stability that Windows Server does not, but this is an outdated point.",2018
833,Faulty hardware drivers can cripple both Windows and Linux OSes.,2018
834,Don't choose a server OS based on outdated notions of stability; Windows and Linux are at the same stability level when it comes to server deployments.,2018
835,OSes such as Windows NT Server and Windows 2000 Server had stability issues with graphics drivers and Internet Information Services.,2018
836,"However, Windows Server is a more mature OS.",2018
837,"You can attribute some of this stability to Microsoft's gradual security improvements and features in each new version, such as failover clustering.",2018
838,Microsoft also performs rigorous hardware testing and has a logo certification program for compatibility guarantees with server hardware.,2018
839,Cloud readiness Both Linux and Windows Server support cloud-based computing.,2018
840,"For Linux, you can use the OpenStack cloud framework.",2018
841,"In 2017, over 1,300 users supported OpenStack, and those that implemented it ran 60-80% of their infrastructure on OpenStack, according to the organization.",2018
842,Microsoft markets Windows Server as a cloud OS.,2018
843,"Microsoft Azure runs on top of Windows Server and Hyper-V. Microsoft's software as a service offering, Office 365, also runs on Windows Server and Hyper-V.",2018
844,"Many third-party cloud service providers, such as Amazon, Rackspace and Google, allow customers to create virtualized Windows Server instances in the cloud.",2018
845,Cost of ownership in the data center Linux is technically a free OS.,2018
846,"Most free distributions, however, offer no guarantee of uniformity or consistent performance.",2018
847,"To select the best server OS for enterprise-level deployments, you should ignore the myth that Linux is free and Windows is not.",2018
848,"With Linux, you pay for support.",2018
849,"This is why the most widely adopted Linux server OSes come from vendors such as Red Hat, Suse and Ubuntu, which charge for support contracts and provide constant maintenance.",2018
850,"When it comes to a Linux server vs. a Windows Server, Linux is less expensive because of its pricing structure.",2018
851,"There's no such thing as per-user licensing of Linux distributions, so the potential cost savings of migrating servers from Windows to Linux is significant.",2018
852,"This cost discrepancy is because, with Windows, you have to purchase server OS licenses and client access licenses.",2018
853,"Microsoft, however, allows its customers to operate Windows Server in the Azure cloud for a fraction of the cost of a license.",2018
854,"Over the past year, more organizations have expressed interest in implementing Windows Server 2016.",2018
855,Licensing is no longer a major consideration for organizations that deploy a large number of virtualized Windows servers as long as the Hyper-V hosts have the proper licenses.,2018
856,The 2016 version of Windows Server Datacenter edition with Hyper-V virtualization can run an unlimited number of Windows Server virtual machines (VMs).,2018
857,"IT security: Linux server vs. Windows Server The documentation that denotes the structure of an open source OS such as Linux is public information, which some people consider a disadvantage for security.",2018
858,"The fact that interested parties can access different aspects of the OS, however, also makes it easier to detect and fix bugs.",2018
859,"In a proprietary OS such as Windows Server, you can observe a bug, but then support technicians must fix the issue.",2018
860,The Linux open source code also provides modularity as a security benefit.,2018
861,You can run tasks across multiple OSes and increase data center security instead of running many services on a multipurpose server.,2018
862,"If one virus attacks one task, you don't lose all server functionality and can quickly bring the corrupted task back online.",2018
863,"Linux also uses mandatory access control systems, such as Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux), to reduce vulnerabilities and block all unneeded system calls.",2018
864,There is no equivalent to SELinux for Windows Server.,2018
865,Microsoft routinely releases security patches for the Windows Server OS as it discovers new vulnerabilities.,2018
866,"It also provides extensive documentation on how to use built-in Windows Server security controls, as well as tips for establishing network architecture to achieve a robust server OS security framework.",2018
867,Each new version of Windows Server introduces features intended to strengthen OS security.,2018
868,"Windows Server 2016 introduced the shielded VM feature for Hyper-V, which protects Hyper-V VMs against users who have physical host access.",2018
869,Windows Server is the best server OS for corporate authentication capabilities.,2018
870,"Active Directory is a full authentication and authorization platform that integrates applications, users and computers.",2018
871,Linux distribution alternatives to Active Directory don't have the same hardware and application support.,2018
872,Data center hardware needs Linux doesn't require as much hardware as Windows.,2018
873,"You can run a decent Linux server with 256 MB of RAM and a disk with just a couple of gigabytes, but that's not the typical workload in a corporate data center.",2018
874,There's less OS overhead for a Linux server vs. a Windows Server for large database systems.,2018
875,"The Linux kernel is highly customizable, and you can make it even more efficient with update scheduling, recompilation and user space settings.",2018
876,"The hardware requirements for Windows Server 2016 vary depending on the server's workload, but Windows Server can run on a system with 512 MB of RAM, 1.4 of GHz -- 64-bit -- CPU and a minimum of 32 GB of disk space.",2018
877,"There are many remote server management tools -- from out-of-the-box offerings to more advanced, configurable software.",2018
878,"The tool you choose should depend on the characteristics of the environment you manage, as well as the cost and complexity constraints of your organization.",2018
879,"Windows environments can employ Remote Server Administration Tools (RSAT), which enable IT administrators to manage Windows Server systems from a remote desktop running the Windows 10 Professional, Enterprise or Education editions.",2018
880,RSAT is available for free from Microsoft's Download Center.,2018
881,"Windows environments can also use Windows Admin Center, which provides a browser-based remote server management tool to manage Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 10, and other systems via a gateway installed on a Windows Server 2016 or Windows 10 host.",2018
882,The gateway relies on well-established Remote PowerShell and Windows Management Instrumentation-over-Windows Remote Management tool sets to securely connect and manage servers from anywhere using Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome.,2018
883,Windows Admin Center is available free from Microsoft.,2018
884,"Most features available in free tools, such as Microsoft's tools, focus on secure communication, and they rely on the management capabilities already installed in Windows operating systems.",2018
885,"For example, RSAT includes Active Directory Domain Services tools, Group Policy Management tools, domain name system/Dynamic Host Control Protocol server functions, File Service tools and a Share and Storage Management Console snap-in tool.",2018
886,Microsoft's Storage Spaces Direct is a feature in Windows Server 2016 that uses commodity hardware to create highly available and scalable software-defined storage as a lower-cost alternative to a SAN.,2018
887,"Like any enterprise-class storage architecture, planning is key to meeting Storage Spaces Direct requirements and achieving a successful deployment.",2018
888,This is especially true for the disks attached to the Storage Spaces Direct nodes.,2018
889,"Storage Spaces Direct provides a low-cost way of building scalable, highly available storage.",2018
890,"But to do so, you must be sure to select storage hardware that complies with the Storage Spaces Direct requirements.",2018
891,Storage Spaces Direct is based on the use of commodity servers that act as cluster nodes.,2018
892,Storage Spaces Direct requirements include at least two servers.,2018
893,"The architecture can be scaled to include as many as 16 servers, each with as much as 100 TB of raw storage capacity.",2018
894,"However, there's a trade-off between node count and server capacity.",2018
895,"The nodes used in a Storage Spaces Direct deployment can collectively support as much as 1 petabyte of raw storage, meaning a 16-node deployment is limited to supporting a maximum of 62.5 TB of storage per node.",2018
896,Additional factors must be considered beyond raw storage capacity.,2018
897,"For instance, each node must be outfitted with at least four drives that provide storage capacity.",2018
898,Microsoft calls these capacity drives.,2018
899,You couldn't simply install a single 100 TB drive into a node and call it a day.,2018
900,The capacity has to be spread across four or more drives.,2018
901,"Brien Posey, Microsoft MVP, discusses Storage Spaces Direct features

Cache drives recommended Storage Spaces Direct also enables the use of cache disks.",2018
902,"They aren't mandatory, but they are recommended and can improve storage performance.",2018
903,"If you do use cache drives, you'll need a minimum of two per server in addition to the capacity drives.",2018
904,The cache drives should be SSDs with a durability rating of at least three full disk writes per day.,2018
905,Any SSDs installed for cache or capacity storage must also be equipped with power loss protection.,2018
906,Planning is key to meeting Storage Spaces Direct requirements and achieving a successful deployment.,2018
907,"If you install cache drives into your nodes, they will also play a role in the capacity drive architecture.",2018
908,"Although not a requirement, Microsoft recommends that the number of capacity drives be an even multiple of the number of cache drives installed.",2018
909,"For example, if you install two cache drives, then you might install four or six capacity drives for symmetry.",2018
910,"Microsoft claims that this will provide better performance than if you used, say, three or five drives.",2018
911,"As you plan the storage architecture and delve into Storage Spaces Direct requirements, remember that storage hardware must be identical in each node.",2018
912,"The nodes must have the same number of disks, and the capacity of each disk must be the same from one node to the next.",2018
913,Storage Spaces Direct is the virtualized storage component of Windows Server 2016.,2018
914,Let's clear up some misconceptions about storage.,2018
915,"First, cloud storage isn't always hosted on a public service, such as AWS and Microsoft Azure.",2018
916,"And second, virtualization and virtualized data storage don't just refer to virtual servers or desktop systems hosted on VMware ESX or Microsoft Hyper-V.",2018
917,"These two misconceptions are related, because one true thing about cloud storage is that it is virtualized.",2018
918,"To a certain extent, all storage is virtualized.",2018
919,Even the most basic block-based hardware system -- a single hard disk -- is mapped by the storage controller attached to the hard disk.,2018
920,"This translates the physical hardware blocks, sectors and tracks on the hard drive's physical disks into a virtual set of blocks, sectors and tracks that the motherboard and storage controller use to communicate with the physical disk.",2018
921,"Likewise, file-based storage creates an SMB or NFS volume containing files and metadata, even though the underlying file system might be different from the one presented by the storage system.",2018
922,"Many file servers use more modern file systems, such as ZFS, instead of SMB or NFS, and then translate.",2018
923,Others use CIFS or NFS and present the volume as both.,2018
924,"That way, an SMB volume can be presented as an NFS volume and vice versa.",2018
925,This is also a type of virtualized data storage.,2018
926,The truth about virtualized data storage Storage virtualization refers to storage that isn't directly accessible to the storage consumer.,2018
927,"It can be a server, server instance, client system or other system that needs storage.",2018
928,Nearly all storage in the data center and public and private clouds is virtualized.,2018
929,One true thing about cloud storage is that it is virtualized.,2018
930,Even iSCSI volumes and Fibre Channel LUNs that appear to be block devices and theoretically identical to an internal hard disk can be considered virtualized.,2018
931,"They're generally RAID volumes, which mean that several physical disks are presented as one or more virtual disks.",2018
932,"In addition, software features, such as tiering, snapshots and replication, require a virtualization layer between the physical storage and the consumer.",2018
933,"Deduplication, compression and object storage layers add additional layers of virtualized data storage.",2018
934,Virtualization can be useful.,2018
935,"A volume that appears to an application or end user as a single contiguous directory tree may include files hosted on different storage tiers, some on local hard disks and others on low-cost cloud storage tiers.",2018
936,"This results in high-performance storage at the lowest possible cost, because virtualized data storage lets files that haven't been accessed for a while be moved to inexpensive storage.",2018
937,"The importance and value of a formal degree, such as an information systems management degree, has become a matter of debate for modern businesses and IT staff.",2018
938,The short answer is still yes; a degree is a good launching point for a career in IT.,2018
939,Job candidates who possess a formal degree in information systems management can demonstrate the successful completion of a prescribed course of study that forms the foundation of a professional career that spans a wide range of potential task areas.,2018
940,"An information systems management degree program includes coursework such as the organizational use of information systems (IS), basics of IS, ethics in IT, software and hardware infrastructure concepts, database concepts, enterprise IT architecture, IS project management, systems analysis, business continuity planning, trends and applications in IS, and more.",2018
941,This offers a broad set of basic knowledge that can lead to opportunities in varied IT roles.,2018
942,"For example, IT job seekers with an IS management degree can become involved in systems administration, network administration, systems and network security, developing and deploying data center infrastructure, and working with data, including big data analytics.",2018
943,"Information systems management degrees are often related to job titles such as information systems manager, systems analyst, application analyst, data analyst/scientist, database administrator, IT technical support officer and systems developer.",2018
944,But a formal degree -- especially at the associate and bachelor's degree levels -- is just a launching pad.,2018
945,"For employers and job seekers alike, knowing the basics isn't enough to be successful.",2018
946,It is virtually impossible for a Bachelor of Science degree alone to adequately prepare a candidate to step into a role that involves the many complex technologies and services that modern businesses use in day-to-day operations.,2018
947,That takes practical work experience.,2018
948,"In practice, an information systems management degree is table stakes for any candidate seeking an entry-level IT position.",2018
949,"But many of the routine tasks expected of that job candidate are learned on the job, such as using Microsoft System Center Operations Manager to administer a set of Windows Server 2016 systems according to the organization's established policies and practices.",2018
950,"As tools, frameworks, systems, and even policies and practices are upgraded and replaced over time, IT professionals must continue to advance their knowledge through practical work experience and continuing education.",2018
951,It is this persistent demand for continuing IT education that has gradually led businesses to de-emphasize the role of traditional college degrees in favor of more industry-focused and vendor-specific certifications.,2018
952,"An information systems management degree will get a candidate in the door, but it is unlikely that an IT professional will advance that degree as a job priority.",2018
953,"Instead, the IT employee will pursue one or more relevant industry certifications, such as a Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) variant, such as CCNA Data Center; a Microsoft Certified Solutions Expert (MCSE) variant, such as MCSE: Cloud Platform and Infrastructure; or countless other potential certifications.",2018
954,Industry certifications enable IT professionals to tailor their expertise to meet the requirements of specific employers.,2018
955,And unlike a degree -- which is a lifetime credential -- IT certifications are typically renewed every few years to ensure current competence.,2018
956,Wasabi Technologies hopes to spark greater enterprise cloud storage adoption with the elimination of its network egress fees.,2018
957,"While Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud make you pay bandwidth charges to get data off their public clouds, Wasabi now offers customers a flat pricing option.",2018
958,"Wasabi will charge a flat fee of $.0049 per gigabyte, per month, or $4.99 per terabyte, per month, inclusive of any API calls, such as PUT, GET and POST.",2018
959,"Customers already using the vendor's cloud can stick with Wasabi's old pricing scheme of $3.99 per terabyte, per month, and 4 cents per gigabyte for data transfer, with no charge for API calls.",2018
960,But Wasabi Technologies CEO David Friend said the new free-egress pricing model is resonating with current users and drawing increased interest from potential new customers.,2018
961,"Friend said about 150 Wasabi customers asked to switch to the new pricing model within the first week, forcing the company to assign staffers to work full time to handle the requests.",2018
962,"He said daily trials of Wasabi cloud storage spiked about 30% during that time, and 8,000 to 10,000 potential new customers contacted the company -- ""way up from prior weeks.""",2018
963,Flat pricing success at Carbonite David Friend David Friend Interest has been so great that Friend questioned why he didn't come up with the free-egress idea sooner.,2018
964,"He said unlimited backup at a flat price was popular at his former company, Carbonite, an early cloud storage provider with services tailored to consumers and small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs).",2018
965,"""People just loved that plan, because they knew exactly how much"" their storage would cost, he said.",2018
966,"Wasabi Technologies claims an enterprise hoping to move 1 PB of data stored in Amazon to another vendor would face up to $90,000 in egress fees to transfer the data.",2018
967,"""That's vendor lock-in -- and, boy, I heard that from I can't tell you how many people,"" Friend said.",2018
968,"""That's the one that really irritates them.""",2018
969,"Egress is hot customer topic Morro Data, a startup based in Fremont, Calif., sells CloudNAS services that combine its on-premises cache appliances with cloud-based object storage from Amazon, Backblaze or Wasabi.",2018
970,COO Michael Clegg said the topic of egress comes up in nearly every discussion about pricing with the company's SMB customers.,2018
971,"""We see a lot of customers that want some predictability in their pricing.",2018
972,"They more or less know how much data they have, and they can easily calculate the storage and service fee.",2018
973,"But the unknown is always the egress issue,"" Clegg said.",2018
974,"""The idea that 'I'm paying you to store my data, but then you're going to charge me to get it back,' has always been an odd conversation to have.""",2018
975,Clegg predicted Morro Data's SMB customers would start to select Wasabi Technologies over the other cloud storage options.,2018
976,"He said free egress is a great move for the industry, but it would take a load of users moving their data to lower-cost services such as Wasabi and Backblaze to compel ""the big guys"" to react.",2018
977,"Amazon rolls on Raj Bala, a Gartner research director, noted that complex cloud storage pricing has had little impact on Amazon, with its projected $20 billion run rate for this year.",2018
978,"He said Wasabi Technologies might have a chance to shake up the public cloud storage market, but its lack of an application to feed the storage is a challenge.",2018
979,"Amazon's object-based Simple Storage Service did not take off until the company's Elastic Compute Cloud became available, Bala said.",2018
980,Bala pointed out that many enterprises use AWS or Microsoft Azure for compute services in addition to storage.,2018
981,"According to Bala, analytics workloads are the top drivers for data in public clouds.",2018

1019,Guest clusters are failover clusters in which all of the cluster nodes are virtual machines.,2018
1020,Guest clustering provides a way to achieve high availability for individual workloads.,2018
1021,"Like Windows failover clusters based on physical servers, guest clusters have a dependency on a cluster shared volume.",2018
1022,The cluster shared volume is shared storage that is accessible to all of the nodes in the cluster.,2018
1023,The technique used for creating a cluster shared volume can vary considerably depending on the hypervisor that is being used and its version.,2018
1024,"Microsoft Hyper-V, for example, has long used a shared VHDX file for guest clustering, although the 2016 version of Hyper-V supports a newer type of virtual hard disk file called a VHD Set.",2018
1025,Shared VHDX Shared VHDX was first introduced in Windows Server 2012 R2 and continues to be supported in Windows Server 2016.,2018
1026,There are three main considerations that must be taken into account when using shared VHDX files to host a guest cluster shared volume.,2018
1027,Physical connectivity.,2018
1028,"In order to use shared VHDX files as a cluster shared volume for your guest clusters, all of the Hyper-V hosts that could potentially host the cluster nodes must be able to access the location in which the VHDX file resides.",2018
1029,"A common misconception is that you must use a block-level protocol, such as iSCSI or Fibre Channel (FC), to connect to a LUN, which, in turn, contains the shared VHDX file.",2018
1030,"While this approach is certainly viable, it is also permissible to store the shared VHDX file on an SMB 3.0 share and connect the Hyper-V hosts to that share using a Universal Naming Convention file path.",2018
1031,How the shared VHDX file will connect to the virtual machines (VMs).,2018
1032,"If you were creating a failover cluster based on physical servers, you would typically need to connect the servers to the cluster shared volume using FC or iSCSI.",2018
1033,"In the case of guest clustering based around a shared VHDX file, Microsoft has made connectivity simpler than it otherwise would be.",2018
1034,"Rather than having to manually configure initiators, you can attach the VM to a shared VHDX file using Hyper-V Manager.",2018
1035,Simply add the shared VHDX file to a virtualized cluster node in the same way that you would attach any other virtual hard disk.,2018
1036,"Once the virtual hard disk is attached, go to the virtual hard disk's Advanced Features tab within Hyper-V Manager, and select Enable virtual hard disk sharing.",2018
1037,You can see what this checkbox looks like here: Select the Enable virtual hard disk sharing checkbox.,2018
1038,Keep in mind that you will have to repeat this process for each node within the guest cluster.,2018
1039,"Upon doing so, you will need to deploy the failover cluster feature on each node and then form the guest cluster.",2018
1040,Limitations associated with using shared VHDX files.,2018
1041,"If you look back at the previous screen capture, you will notice a warning message stating that some VM and virtual hard disk features will be disabled when you enable virtual hard disk sharing.",2018
1042,This message alludes to three limitations associated with basing guest clusters around a shared VHDX file.,2018
1043,You cannot back up a guest cluster using a Hyper-V host-level backup.,2018
1044,"Instead, you will have to install a backup agent on the cluster nodes and perform a guest-level backup.",2018
1045,"While it is possible to perform a live migration of guest cluster nodes, you cannot perform a live migration of the shared VHDX file.",2018
1046,You cannot resize a shared VHDX file while the guest cluster is online.,2018
1047,Hyper-converged infrastructure has become an increasingly complex segment of the data center architecture market over the last few years.,2018
1048,The definition of hyper-convergence has expanded as this technology continues to fracture into more targeted products.,2018
1049,One critical aspect of HCI that's evolved over time is hypervisor support.,2018
1050,Examples of hypervisors used in hyper-convergence vary.,2018
1051,"Early iterations of common hyper-converged systems focused on extending the capabilities of offerings from companies such as VMware and, later, Microsoft.",2018
1052,"Early hyper-converged offerings for VMware vSphere or Microsoft Hyper-V may look and act like modern examples of hypervisors in hyper-converged products, but they were intended to simplify and lower the cost of storage for smaller organizations, and that was pretty much it.",2018
1053,"But over time, some HCI vendors turned to the open source kernel-based virtual machine (KVM) hypervisor as an alternative.",2018
1054,"HCI pioneer Nutanix is one of the vendors with its own KVM-based hypervisor, but there are others.",2018
1055,Let's explore examples of hypervisors used in HCI over the years as we assess how the role of the hypervisor in hyper-convergence has changed and continues to evolve.,2018
1056,The rise of vSphere Support for vSphere made a lot of sense for early HCI vendors.,2018
1057,"VMware was, and still is, the hypervisor-market leader, even if the product's dominance is fading with the rise of Microsoft's Hyper-V and KVM.",2018
1058,"Businesses seeking cheaper alternatives to virtualization are turning to the public cloud to meet needs, such as moving email off premises and deploying customer relationship management platforms.",2018
1059,"Because of these changes, there's less need for on-premises services that include vSphere.",2018
1060,"VMware is, of course, working hard to counter vSphere's decline with the constant addition of new services and new operational methodologies, including the ability to operate directly in Amazon data centers.",2018
1061,One reason for vSphere's dominance has been the broad ecosystem that has come into existence over the past decade and a half as VMware has grown.,2018
1062,"Today, there are hundreds, if not thousands, of companies providing products that support vSphere.",2018
1063,"Enter KVM So considering vSphere's massive ecosystem and mature features, why would KVM even be on people's minds?",2018
1064,"Cost is one reason, but there are several others.",2018
1065,KVM allows enterprises to reduce hypervisor licensing expenses.,2018
1066,"Given its enterprise licensing model, Hyper-V generally isn't that expensive.",2018
1067,"However, vSphere customers have faced steadily increasing costs over the years, giving CIOs and other decision-makers tough choices.",2018
1068,"VSphere is the core of many data center environments, and supplanting it is expensive and technically challenging.",2018
1069,"But as the price delta among vSphere and its competitors increases, the financial justification for making the jump has become easier as organizations seek to avoid the ""VMware tax.""",2018
1070,"Some hyper-converged companies have built their entire platform around the KVM hypervisor, going beyond simply adding KVM support.",2018
1071,"Seeing an opportunity, HCI vendors have either introduced support for KVM or built their platforms around the open source hypervisor.",2018
1072,Hyper-convergence for KVM began in a simple manner because of the way many hyper-converged products are designed.,2018
1073,Most use what's called a virtual storage appliance.,2018
1074,The VSA is the running VM that manages storage local to a hyper-converged node and coordinates with VSAs running on the other nodes in a cluster.,2018
1075,"The VSA model provides flexibility, enabling hypervisors to be swapped out as long as the HCI vendor supports swapping.",2018
1076,"Early on, some vendors augmented vSphere support with Hyper-V or KVM support.",2018
1077,"Some hyper-converged companies have built their entire platform around the KVM hypervisor, going beyond simply adding KVM support.",2018
1078,"In these cases, KVM forms the core of the architecture with no plans to add support for other hypervisors.",2018
1079,"Whereas VSA-centric hypervisor-support models use a VSA, HCI architectures without multi-hypervisor support don't need to worry about this abstraction of storage management.",2018
1080,"The OS on the local node provides access to local storage, and, in some cases, a kernel hypervisor module may accomplish this goal.",2018
1081,"There's a sense of simplicity in these VSA-less architectures and, depending on how the product is built, there can be performance benefits, too.",2018
1082,"Moreover, HCI vendors that have chosen to use KVM as a key part of their platform -- such as Cloudistics Inc., Nutanix and Scale Computing -- have modified and extended KVM to meet the feature-set expectations for hypervisors in the modern enterprise.",2018
1083,"For example, Scale Computing included its patented storage system, called Scribe (Scale Computing Reliable Independent Block Engine).",2018
1084,"Not technically added to KVM, Scribe integrates with Scale Computing's KVM variant to provide completely integrated storage with increased performance over other HCI platforms that rely on VSAs and other storage features.",2018
1085,"Storage is just one aspect of a complete hyper-converged platform, of course.",2018
1086,Cloudistics and Nutanix are bringing more networking capabilities into their platforms and adding more features customers can use alongside the KVM hypervisor.,2018
1087,"Cloudistics, for example, features a software-defined network that enables deeper application control.",2018
1088,"Nutanix recently introduced Flow, which provides advanced networking and application-centric network security capabilities.",2018
1089,"Nutanix's Flow service is tightly integrated with its AHV virtualization, which is based on KVM.",2018
1090,"AHV is the hypervisor for Nutanix Acropolis, the OS for the company's HCI.",2018
1091,Is the startup risk a major concern?,2018
1092,There are tradeoffs to using KVM or any of the other examples of hypervisors cited here.,2018
1093,"The VMware ecosystem is vast, and VMware isn't going away anytime soon.",2018
1094,"Nutanix became a public company in 2016 and appears to be doing well, but others that provide KVM-centric hyper-converged systems are still privately held startups.",2018
1095,"These include Cloudistics, Maxta and Scale Computing.",2018
1096,"And no matter how strong a technology appears, there's always the risk the company you've bought it from won't make it over the long term.",2018
1097,"My advice is, because you don't know whether the vendor you chose for your hyper-converged system will be around forever -- and how could you?",2018
1098,-- consider a shorter time horizon.,2018
1099,"If your company's replacement cycle is three to five years, that's the length of time that you need that vendor to survive.",2018
1100,"It just needs to make it five more years after you buy, and you'll be at your next replacement cycle.",2018
1101,"Education, skills and training Any enterprise that's been involved in virtualization for any length of time will have IT staff with deep skills in VMware or Microsoft technologies.",2018
1102,"As such, learning KVM may be a bridge too far, particularly if you're also making the jump into a new architecture, such as hyper-converged infrastructure.",2018
1103,"Here's the thing, though: Hyper-converged infrastructures that use KVM as the only hypervisor option also include easy-to-use administrative interfaces that hide most, if not all, of the complexity that may accompany a switch.",2018
1104,I have a three-node Scale Computing cluster in my lab that I use for testing and building projects.,2018
1105,I describe its hypervisor management interface as uncomfortably bare.,2018
1106,"That's not intended as a negative statement, and although I don't like the term nerd knobs, I will say that Scale Computing's management interface doesn't have many at all.",2018
1107,It's just point-and-click.,2018
1108,"If you want to move a VM to another node, just click on the ""Move VM"" icon and choose a node.",2018
1109,Setting up a schedule to send snapshots to a remote cluster requires only a couple of clicks.,2018
1110,"Other KVM-centric hyper-converged platforms have more hypervisor functionality than Scale Computing (for example, Cloudistics and Nutanix AHV), but they come with more complexity.",2018
1111,That may work for some people and not for others.,2018
1112,"If you have a hardcore virtualization background, you might want deeper configuration parameters that aren't there with some products.",2018
1113,"If you can't tweak every parameter, how can you get the most out of your cluster?",2018
1114,Compare and contrast hyper-converged products before making the jump so you get the level of hypervisor configurability you want.,2018
1115,Perhaps the biggest issue when it comes to skills is how to migrate hundreds or thousands of VMs from vSphere to KVM.,2018
1116,"Fortunately, there are tools available to help with these transitions, such as Red Hat's virt-v2v or Carbonite's HC3 Move Powered for Scale Computing.",2018
1117,These tools help customers migrate vSphere VMs and Windows Servers to the KVM format.,2018
1118,"Of the myriad reasons that Glenn Pinnel, vice president and CIO at Benjamin Moore & Co., opted for a multi-cloud strategy, flexibility, agility and cost-optimization were paramount.",2018

1199,"Steve Lippman, ESG engagement director at Microsoft, talks to Ben Maiden about how the tech company tries to make a difference with its disclosures and engage effectively with shareholders

How did the ESG function come about at Microsoft, and how did you get involved?",2019
1200,"I’ve been at Microsoft for 11 years, always in an ESG [capacity] although we’ve used other terms.",2019
1201,"It started off being called citizenship and we evolved that term to CSR, but it’s really focused on the ESG topics at Microsoft.",2019
1202,We sit within what’s now called our corporate external and legal affairs department.,2019
1203,"[We report] up to our president and chief legal officer Brad Smith, who sits on our senior leadership team.",2019
1204,The topic always had that representation at the senior leadership level.,2019
1205,We’ve had a great partnership between the CSR function looking at transparency and reporting and our investor relations (IR) team and corporate secretary’s office.,2019
1206,"Functionally, our engagement with investors on these ESG topics has gone on for a long time with collaboration between those groups.",2019
1207,In the last year we have formally pulled that outreach function from the CSR team to the corporate secretary’s office.,2019
1208,How many people work solely on ESG issues?,2019
1209,"It’s so widely embedded across Microsoft that the cast of characters numbers in the hundreds, if not more, across the span of issues.",2019
1210,"When it comes to thinking about transparency, reporting and engagement with investors, that quickly becomes a much more centralized group of probably two or three people.",2019
1211,"But again, that’s relying on great partnerships and collaboration with many hundreds of colleagues across Microsoft.",2019
1212,"Your approach to ESG reporting uses a variety of platforms, including a privacy dashboard and blog posts.",2019
1213,"What are some of the key tools you use, and how do you ensure they deliver valuable disclosure rather than just marketing materials?",2019
1214,"In terms of our formal CSR reporting, we’ve been a long-term proponent of global reporting initiatives and sustainability reporting guidelines – which are now reporting standards – and look a lot to global external standards to guide that reporting.",2019
1215,We’re a signatory to the UN Global Compact and we issue our annual communication on progress.,2019
1216,"We were one of the first companies to follow the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, and there’s a UN Guiding Principles Reporting Framework.",2019
1217,We’ve released at least one white paper that bucketed the work we do according to the UN Sustainable Development Goals.,2019
1218,We also look at [SASB] or the Task Force on Climate related Financial Disclosures to help guide our reporting.,2019
1219,We seek to ensure our reporting follows those external multi-stakeholder frameworks and I think that helps keep it robust and evidence-based.,2019
1220,The other thing I would say is that in the age of Twitter and 280 characters we’re starting to go the other way in terms of communicating about important issues in book length [publications].,2019
1221,Last year we put out a book – The future computed: Artificial intelligence and its role in society – that looked at what the ethical framework is for evaluating AI.,2019

1223,"Brad and Carol Ann Browne, our director of executive communications, also have a book coming out called Tools and weapons: The promise and the peril of the digital age.",2019
1224,"Again, we are trying to stimulate an informed discussion about issues as opposed to saying we can fit the right answer into a soundbite.",2019
1225,The right approach is complicated and will take multi-stakeholder efforts.,2019
1226,"We’ve called for government regulation of the use of facial recognition technology, for instance.",2019

1229,How do you decide what the key ESG issues are for your company?,2019
1230,"Is that something you reappraise on an annual basis, or do you take a more ad hoc approach?",2019
1231,I think there is an evolution.,2019
1232,What’s helpful sitting within what’s essentially the legal department is that the department maps to every part of Microsoft.,2019
1233,Every business and operational group and every geographical subsidiary has a lawyer who is thinking not just about legal risk but also about brand and reputation and stakeholder interests.,2019
1234,"As a result, we have a fairly cohesive but broad community of people who are seeing emerging issues, whether those are legal and regulatory issues, more reputational issues or issues that employees are raising.",2019
1235,That group gets together once a year for a global meeting.,2019
1236,"It’s about 1,000 people who come together from around the world in Redmond, [Washington] to look at a set of preselected questions.",2019
1237,"That takes place about six months before the start of the next fiscal year when budgets are set, and we have a chance to shape our thinking and look at emerging issues.",2019
1238,Are those just ESG issues or the full range of issues the company may be facing?,2019
1239,I think both.,2019
1240,At this point those two sets almost overlap.,2019
1241,"They look at geopolitical risk, emerging regulatory frameworks or emerging businesses Microsoft might be looking to expand in, but also core ESG subjects, whether that’s AI ethics, privacy, environmental sustainability, human rights, the rights of LGBT employees around the world – it’s a broad range.",2019
1242,How do you collect data for reporting purposes?,2019
1243,Is it done through this network in other business units?,2019
1244,Yes.,2019
1245,"We benefit from having a significant number of long-tenured employees, so this is a community that’s worked together over the years.",2019
1246,"I will be quite honest in saying that whenever we seek to report new information, it’s a painful process.",2019
1247,"It takes time to think through a range of issues in terms of what’s meaningful to stakeholders, what will help them judge our performance, what might be confidential and what legal risks there might be.",2019
1248,"Over time, however, as we work through those issues, reporting what was once difficult becomes routine.",2019
1249,"A perfect example is our law enforcement request reports and our content removal request reports, which we’ve done every six months for five or six years now.",2019
1250,"I was involved in getting those started and it was a very challenging, thoughtful exercise.",2019
1251,Now it’s like filing your taxes – it’s just that time of year to get the data together and put it out into the marketplace.,2019
1252,Who do you work with primarily in-house in terms of shareholder engagement?,2019
1253,Is it the IR team or the corporate secretary’s office?,2019
1254,"We have the luxury now that my role is essentially leading that effort – leading shareholder engagement in an integrated way across ESG topics, including traditional corporate secretary governance topics.",2019
1255,Investor relations is a great partner with us.,2019
1256,We do about 50 engagement calls with institutional investors on ESG over the summer usually.,2019
1257,"We’ve also done a number of ESG roadshows on which we go to markets that really care about these issues, such as London.",2019
1258,"Starting last year, we did a joint [trip] with IR, our corporate secretary and me across Europe, hitting six or seven countries in order to experiment with having a fully integrated discussion about the business fundamentals and ESG issues.",2019
1259,It feels like we’ve been talking about the same issues for 10 years – what’s changed is who’s interested in listening.,2019
1260,"Increasingly, where we [once had] those conversations with public pension funds or European investors let’s say five or six years ago, now those conversations are part of almost every governance engagement with the largest names on Wall Street.",2019
1261,Are you finding changes in the information investors want?,2019
1262,The issue that has surprised me – as someone who has been in the field for a long time – is this tremendous and widespread focus on human capital management that’s emerged in the last 24 months or so.,2019
1263,"We saw a lot of interest in climate, and certainly climate is really important to Microsoft and to a number of investors.",2019
1264,"But just as we expected climate to hit an inflection point, it felt to me that the conversation shifted to being much more around topics of human capital management.",2019
1265,What has your experience been in terms of getting board directors involved in shareholder engagement?,2019
1266,"We have a great board of directors and John Thompson, our independent chair, is a wonderful partner in terms of being interested in leaning in to engage with shareholders.",2019
1267,"We tend to save his time for a few of our very largest investors, which tend to have been the ones that have asked.",2019
1268,"In an effort to reach a broader part of our investor base, we’ve also had John speak.",2019
1269,"He’s given a keynote at the Council of Institutional Investors, for example.",2019
1270,There are other ways to make contact with a wider audience without the time and transaction costs of one-on-one engagement.,2019
1271,It’s been a mix of both.,2019
1272,"At least in my experience, the majority of investors might be interested in talking to a director every several years or so but, absent a big controversial corporate governance challenge, they otherwise seem quite happy to talk to representatives of management.",2019
1273,What’s your approach to engagement in terms of timing across the year?,2019
1274,"Our annual meeting is in late November, early December, which helps a bit in terms of being outside the crush of the annual meeting season.",2019
1275,"We do the bulk of our one-on-one engagement over the summer before our proxy is published, after which we go back to that same set of investors to offer them the opportunity to connect.",2019
1276,"In the past year, probably 80 percent or 90 percent of investors have preferred the summer off-cycle and just a handful have wanted to wait and talk after the proxy is filed.",2019
1277,"Is it important for your ESG reporting and engagement to address the opportunities presented by these issues, not just the risks?",2019
1278,Definitely – and also to emphasize how some of the risks can be opportunities.,2019
1279,"One example is around the EU [General Data Protection Regulation] (GDPR), under which fines for violations can be up to 4 percent of global revenue, which is an eye-popping number when you think about Microsoft or any of our peer companies’ revenues.",2019
1280,So the risk is there and there’s a significant compliance component.,2019
1281,"But what’s interesting about GDPR – and Microsoft welcomed it and we’ve applied the key concepts of it to our customers around the world, not just the EU – is that it changes the value proposition for a number of our callout services.",2019
1282,"Suddenly if you’re a mid-sized US company with employees or customers in Europe and are subject to the GDPR, do you want to take on that risk in-house and rely on your own IT department?",2019
1283,Or do you want to trust Microsoft cloud services where we’ve put in contractual guarantees that will ensure GDPR compliance for you?,2019
1284,That provides a nice example of where something is the right thing to do in terms of protecting customers’ privacy and it’s important from a compliance and legal risk perspective – but it also changes the value proposition of products we offer.,2019
1285,"This interview appeared in Corporate Secretary’s special report on ESG engagement, reporting and integration",2019
1286,Machine learning enhanced with artificial intelligence (AI) holds great promise in addressing many of the global cyber challenges we see today.,2019
1287,"They give our cyber defenders the ability to identify, detect, and block malware, almost instantaneously.",2019
1288,"And together they give security admins the ability to deconflict tasks, separating the signal from the noise, allowing them to prioritize the most critical tasks.",2019
1289,"It is why today, I’m pleased to announce that Azure Sentinel, a cloud-native SIEM that provides intelligent security analytics at cloud scale for enterprises of all sizes and workloads, is now generally available.",2019
1290,Our goal has remained the same since we first launched Microsoft Azure Sentinel in February: empower security operations teams to help enhance the security posture of our customers.,2019
1291,Traditional Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solutions have not kept pace with the digital changes.,2019
1292,"I commonly hear from customers that they’re spending more time with deployment and maintenance of SIEM solutions, which leaves them unable to properly handle the volume of data or the agility of adversaries.",2019
1293,"Recent research tells us that 70 percent of organizations continue to anchor their security analytics and operations with SIEM systems,1 and 82 percent are committed to moving large volumes of applications and workloads to the public cloud.2 Security analytics and operations technologies must lean in and help security analysts deal with the complexity, pace, and scale of their responsibilities.",2019
1294,"To accomplish this, 65 percent of organizations are leveraging new technologies for process automation/orchestration, while 51 percent are adopting security analytics tools featuring machine learning algorithms.3 This is exactly why we developed Azure Sentinel—an SIEM re-invented in the cloud to address the modern challenges of security analytics.",2019
1295,"Learning together

When we kicked off the public preview for Azure Sentinel, we were excited to learn and gain insight into the unique ways Azure Sentinel was helping organizations and defenders on a daily basis.",2019
1296,"We worked with our partners all along the way; listening, learning, and fine-tuning as we went.",2019
1297,"With feedback from 12,000 customers and more than two petabytes of data analysis, we were able to examine and dive deep into a large, complex, and diverse set of data.",2019
1298,All of which had one thing in common: a need to empower their defenders to be more nimble and efficient when it comes to cybersecurity.,2019
1299,Our work with RapidDeploy offers one compelling example of how Azure Sentinel is accomplishing this complex task.,2019
1300,RapidDeploy creates cloud-based dispatch systems that help first responders act quickly to protect the public.,2019
1301,"There’s a lot at stake, and the company’s cloud-native platform must be secure against an array of serious cyberthreats.",2019
1302,"So when RapidDeploy implemented a SIEM system, it chose Azure Sentinel, one of the world’s first cloud-native SIEMs.",2019
1303,"Microsoft recently sat down with Alex Kreilein, Chief Information Security Officer at RapidDeploy.",2019
1304,Here’s what he shared: “We build a platform that helps save lives.,2019
1305,"It does that by reducing incident response times and improving first responder safety by increasing their situational awareness.”

Now RapidDeploy uses the complete visibility, automated responses, fast deployment, and low total cost of ownership in Azure Sentinel to help it safeguard public safety systems.",2019
1306,"“With many SIEMs, deployment can take months,” says Kreilein.",2019
1307,"“Deploying Azure Sentinel took us minutes—we just clicked the deployment button and we were done.”

Learn even more about our work with RapidDeploy by checking out the full story.",2019
1308,Another great example of a company finding results with Azure Sentinel is ASOS.,2019
1309,"As one of the world’s largest online fashion retailers, ASOS knows they’re a prime target for cybercrime.",2019
1310,"The company has a large security function spread across five teams and two sites—but in the past, it was difficult for ASOS to gain a comprehensive view of cyberthreat activity.",2019
1311,"Now, using Azure Sentinel, ASOS has created a bird’s-eye view of everything it needs to spot threats early, allowing it to proactively safeguard its business and its customers.",2019
1312,"And as a result, it has cut issue resolution times in half.",2019
1313,"“There are a lot of threats out there,” says Stuart Gregg, Cyber Security Operations Lead at ASOS.",2019
1314,"“You’ve got insider threats, account compromise, threats to our website and customer data, even physical security threats.",2019
1315,"We’re constantly trying to defend ourselves and be more proactive in everything we do.”

Already using a range of Azure services, ASOS identified Azure Sentinel as a platform that could help it quickly and easily unite its data.",2019
1316,"This includes security data from Azure Security Center and Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), along with data from Microsoft 365.",2019
1317,The result is a comprehensive view of its entire threat landscape.,2019
1318,"“We found Azure Sentinel easy to set up, and now we don’t have to move data across separate systems,” says Gregg.",2019
1319,"“We can literally click a few buttons and all our security solutions feed data into Azure Sentinel.”

Learn more about how ASOS has benefitted from Azure Sentinel.",2019
1320,RapidDeploy and ASOS are just two examples of how Azure Sentinel is helping businesses process data and telemetry into actionable security alerts for investigation and response.,2019
1321,"We have an active GitHub community of preview participants, partners, and even Microsoft’s own security experts who are sharing new connectors, detections, hunting queries, and automation playbooks.",2019
1322,"With these design partners, we’ve continued our innovation in Azure Sentinel.",2019
1323,"It starts from the ability to connect to any data source, whether in Azure or on-premises or even other clouds.",2019
1324,We continue to add new connectors to different sources and more machine learning-based detections.,2019
1325,"Azure Sentinel will also integrate with Azure Lighthouse service, which will enable service providers and enterprise customers with the ability to view Azure Sentinel instances across different tenants in Azure.",2019
1326,"Secure your organization

Now that Azure Sentinel has moved out of public preview and is generally available, there’s never been a better time to see how it can help your business.",2019
1327,"Traditional on-premises SIEMs require a combination of infrastructure costs and software costs, all paired with annual commitments or inflexible contracts.",2019
1328,"We are removing those pain points, since Azure Sentinel is a cost-effective, cloud-native SIEM with predictable billing and flexible commitments.",2019
1329,"Infrastructure costs are reduced since you automatically scale resources as you need, and you only pay for what you use.",2019
1330,Or you can save up to 60 percent compared to pay-as-you-go pricing by taking advantage of capacity reservation tiers.,2019
1331,You receive predictable monthly bills and the flexibility to change capacity tier commitments every 31 days.,2019
1332,"On top of that, bringing in data from Office 365 audit logs, Azure activity logs and alerts from Microsoft Threat Protection solutions doesn’t require any additional payments.",2019

1353,Some companies still store their data in blinking black boxes in a hallway closet.,2019
1354,Others have such massive computing needs that they’ve built their own data centers.,2019

1605,"Microsoft Storage Spaces Direct runs on the storage nodes in a scale-out file server cluster to create the storage tier, and Hyper-V runs on the compute nodes in a separate cluster to create the compute tier.",2019
1606,The converged mode also uses the SMB 3.0 protocol to facilitate communications between the two clusters.,2019
1607,"In the hyper-converged mode, compute and storage resources reside in the same cluster, with storage attached directly to each server in the cluster to create complete but connected compute/storage nodes.",2019
1608,"The hyper-converged mode tends to target SMBs or remote office/branch office deployments, providing a smaller hardware footprint and lower administrative overhead.",2019
1609,"Several vendors now offer HCI based on Storage Spaces Direct, making it possible to purchase a complete HCI that you can quickly and easily deploy in the data center.",2019
1610,"Dell EMC, for example, sells a number of HCI configurations made up of Storage Spaces Direct Ready Nodes, which are built on its PowerEdge servers.",2019

1616,"With Storage Spaces Direct, you can implement both converged and hyper-converged infrastructures using commodity hardware, while eliminating the need for traditional SAN and NAS storage.",2019
1617,"Storage Spaces Direct also offered better resource utilization, in part because the erasure coding feature included such capabilities as Local Reconstruction Codes and real-time tier optimization, making it possible to achieve 2.4 times greater resource efficiency.",2019
1618,"Plus, Storage Spaces Direct could scale up to 16 servers and over 400 drives to provide up to 1 petabyte (PB) of storage per cluster.",2019
1619,"At the same time, a Storage Spaces Direct deployment -- whether all-flash or hybrid -- could deliver over 150,000 mixed 4K random IOPS per server.",2019
1620,"With the release of Windows Server 2019, Microsoft improved Storage Spaces Direct even further.",2019
1621,"For example, Storage Spaces Direct now supports nested resiliency, which makes it possible for a two-node cluster to withstand multiple hardware failures.",2019
1622,"In addition, you can now create a storage pool that supports up to 4 PB per cluster of raw capacity.",2019

1637,"Ultra Disk SSDs support enterprise-grade workloads driven by systems such as MongoDB, SQL Server, SAP HANA and high-performing, mission-critical applications.",2019
1638,"The latest storage tier comes with configurable performance attributes, making it possible to adjust IOPS and throughput to meet evolving performance requirements.",2019
1639,Azure Ultra Disk Storage implements a distributed block storage architecture that uses NVMe to support I/O-intensive workloads.,2019
1640,NVMe is a host controller interface and storage protocol that accelerates data transfers between data center systems and SSDs over a computer's high-speed PCIe bus.,2019
1641,"Ultra Disk Storage makes it possible to utilize a VM's maximum I/O limits using only a single ultra disk, without needing to stripe multiple disks.",2019
1642,"Along with the new storage tier, Azure introduced the virtual disk client (VDC), a simplified client that runs on the compute host.",2019
1643,The client has full knowledge of the virtual disk metadata mappings in the Azure Ultra Disk cluster.,2019
1644,"This knowledge enables the client to communicate directly with the storage servers, bypassing the load balancers and front-end servers often used to establish initial disk connections.",2019
1645,"With earlier Managed Disk storage tiers, the route was much less direct.",2019
1646,"For example, Azure Premium SSD storage is dependent on the Azure Blob storage cache.",2019
1647,"As a result, the compute host runs the Azure Blob Cache Driver, rather than the VDC.",2019
1648,"The driver communicates with a storage front end, which, in turn, communicates with partition servers.",2019
1649,"The partition servers then talk to the stream servers, which connect to the storage devices.",2019
1650,"The VDC, on the other hand, supports a more direct connection, minimizing the number of layers that read and write operations traverse, reducing latency and increasing performance.",2019
1651,"Deploying Ultra Disk Storage Azure Ultra Disk Storage lets you configure capacity, IOPS and throughput independently, providing the flexibility necessary to meet specific performance requirements.",2019
1652,"For capacity, you can choose a disk size ranging from 4 GiB to 64 TiB, and you can provision the disks with up to 300 IOPS per GiB, to a maximum of 160,000 IOPS per disk.",2019
1653,"For throughput, Azure supports up to 2,000 MB per second, per disk.",2019
1654,"Ultra Disk Storage makes it possible to utilize a VM's maximum I/O limits using only a single ultra disk, without needing to stripe multiple disks.",2019
1655,You can also configure disk IOPS or throughput without detaching the disk from the VM or restarting the VM.,2019
1656,Azure automatically implements the new performance settings in less than an hour.,2019
1657,"To deploy Ultra Disk Storage, you can use the Azure Resource Manager, Azure CLI or PowerShell.",2019
1658,"Ultra Disk Storage is currently available in three Azure regions: East US 2, North Europe and Southeast Asia.",2019
1659,"Microsoft plans to extend to other regions, but the company has not provided specific timelines.",2019
1660,"In addition, Ultra Disk Storage supports only the ESv3 and DSv3 Azure VMs.",2019
1661,Azure Ultra Disk handles data durability behind the scenes.,2019
1662,"The service is built on Azure's locally redundant storage (LRS), which maintains three copies of the data within the same availability zone.",2019
1663,"If an application writes data to the storage service, Azure will acknowledge the operation only after the LRS system has replicated the data.",2019
1664,"When implementing Ultra Disk Storage, you must consider the throttling limits Azure places on resources.",2019
1665,"For example, you could configure your VM with a 16-GiB ultra disk at 4,800 IOPS.",2019
1666,"However, if you're working with a Standard_D2s_v3 VM, you won't be able to take full advantage of the storage because the VM gets throttled to 3,200 IOPS as a result of its limitations.",2019
1667,"To realize the full benefits available to Ultra Disk Storage, you need hardware that can support its capabilities.",2019

1723,"In 2016, Microsoft Corp. made headlines when it acquired LinkedIn Corp. for more than US$26 billion.",2019
1724,It was the largest acquisition in company history.,2019
1725,"“I certainly think that the value of the two companies, combined, is greater than the two by themselves,” Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates told Bloomberg News in a television interview after the deal was announced.",2019
1726,"Three years later, there are signs the bold move has paid off.",2019
1727,LinkedIn’s user base has grown by nearly 50 per cent since the deal was announced — from roughly 433 million users to more than 645 million.,2019
1728,Revenue has also been on the rise.,2019
1729,"In the fiscal year that recently ended, LinkedIn generated US$6.8 billion in revenue.",2019
1730,That’s a 28 per cent increase from the year before.,2019
1731,“Things have certainly exceeded our expectations.,2019
1732,"We had a pretty aggressive plan in place and we’ve been able to outperform that plan,” LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner told Bloomberg News in a September television interview.",2019
1733,The driving force behind that outperformance is an improved product.,2019
1734,"People are spending more time on LinkedIn because they are more engaged, whether it’s because of the content on the platform, messaging features, or more relevant connections to other professionals.",2019
1735,"As users spend more time on LinkedIn, it creates more opportunities to generate revenue through higher advertising inventory, more subscriptions, and more user data, which helps improve its recruiter product.",2019
1736,"“LinkedIn is continually creating new ways for members to connect,” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said on Microsoft’s fiscal fourth-quarter earnings call in July.",2019
1737,"The momentum has helped justify the near 50 per cent premium Microsoft paid to beat out rivals such as Salesforce.com Inc., Facebook Inc. and Google parent Alphabet Inc., all of which were reportedly interested in acquiring LinkedIn.",2019
1738,"When the deal was unveiled, skeptics cited Microsoft’s challenges with previous acquisitions such as Nokia Corp. and questioned whether LinkedIn could thrive within the Microsoft empire.",2019
1739,"""It's very difficult to keep the cultures separate,"" Douglas Melsheimer, a partner at investment banking firm Bulger Partners told Bloomberg News in 2016.",2019
1740,"""I can't think of an example of a large-scale acquisition like this where the acquired company really maintained any independence.",2019
1741,"Their fate is sealed, to a degree.”

Three years later, Microsoft’s willingness to allow LinkedIn to largely operate as an independent business has been cited as a key reason for the deal’s success.",2019
1742,"“Satya and the leadership team at Microsoft have been incredibly supportive of that framework,” Weiner said.",2019
1743,"“The philosophy has always been the more we grow LinkedIn, the better it benefits Microsoft and so in that way, we are most definitely aligned.”

The economy has also played a key role in LinkedIn’s continued growth.",2019
1744,"With the U.S. unemployment rate at its lowest level in 50 years, recruiters are constantly on the hunt for good talent.",2019
1745,"Weiner refers to his role as a dream job, often highlighting LinkedIn’s vision statement to “create economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce.” While the CEOs of acquired companies don’t always stick around, keeping him at the helm was a top priority for Nadella, who was keenly aware of Weiner’s popularity among staff.",2019
1746,"And while LinkedIn has benefited from its independence, the two companies have worked closely on a range of initiatives, such as building LinkedIn into Outlook, more integration between LinkedIn Sales Navigator and Microsoft’s Dynamics 365, as well as moving LinkedIn to Microsoft’s Azure cloud.",2019
1747,"From Weiner’s perspective, the moves made so far have only scratched the surface.",2019
1748,“You think about the fact that Microsoft’s products reach over a billion people on a global basis and you start to think about what’s possible.”,2019
1749,"GREENSBORO, N.C. – Bell Partners Inc., one of the nation’s leading apartment investment and management companies, today announced the acquisition of 3040 Apartments, a 243-unit multifamily community located in Redmond, Wash., for $96 million on behalf of its Fund VI investors.",2019
1750,The property will be managed by Bell and renamed Bell Overlake.,2019
1751,"Bell Overlake is Bell Partners’ first acquisition in the Seattle metro area, in addition to the 4 properties the firm manages in the area.",2019

1767,"Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud may lead the cloud market, but the drumbeat of the competition is growing louder from niche alternatives and upstart challengers.",2019
1768,"Other public providers in the mix include the likes of Alibaba Cloud, Dell Technologies' Virtustream, IBM's Bluemix, Iron Mountain, Oracle and Rackspace.",2019
1769,"Meanwhile, startup Wasabi Technologies's low-priced cold storage options drew so much interest out of the starting gate, the company temporarily shut down its trial offer.",2019
1770,"Regional providers include Backblaze, CenturyLink, Joyent and NTT Communications.",2019
1771,Managed providers and systems integrators such as Atmosera and Key Information Systems are also promoting the cloud service delivery model.,2019
1772,"Finally, traditional software vendors are building clouds to exclusively support their particular applications.",2019
1773,"When it comes to cloud storage alternatives to the big three in the cloud service delivery model and compute market, there are too many options to mention here.",2019
1774,"Instead, this article will arm IT professionals with an understanding of how various services deliver viable alternatives to AWS, Azure and Google Cloud, the types of providers out there and what to look for from these cloud services.",2019
1775,"How to beat the big three Several years ago, many large analyst firms predicted the cloud market would be a three-way battle between Amazon, Microsoft and Google.",2019
1776,"While these three remain the market share and name recognition leaders, they are by no means alone.",2019
1777,The second tier of cloud providers offers very competitive pricing while often delivering better service.,2019
1778,"From a technology perspective, most of these second-tier cloud providers have storage architectures similar to their larger competitors.",2019
1779,They use an object storage model that utilizes commodity hardware and software to deliver capacity storage.,2019
1780,"While the big three deploy teams of storage developers, second-tier providers typically use off-the-shelf software, which saves on paying teams of doctorates.",2019
1781,"The big three do buy their hardware at better prices than the tier 2 cloud providers, but the reality is hardware is such a competitive market that the purchase delta between a small and large buyer is relatively small.",2019
1782,The first step in selecting the right provider is for a business to assess its cloud skills.,2019
1783,"From a business model perspective, most second-tier providers focus on a particular capability or product offering.",2019
1784,"For example, many have developed a reputation in the backup data storage market, while others specialize in archive storage.",2019
1785,"There are also second-tier cloud providers that specialize in specific industries like healthcare, government or financial markets.",2019
1786,"Focus and specialization enable them to provide a more white-glove cloud service delivery model, ultimately reducing the time it takes for a customer to move to the cloud.",2019
1787,Types of second-tier providers There are typically three types of second-tier cloud providers.,2019
1788,"The first type, the purpose-built provider, is usually a software developer that has decided to offer a cloud service delivery model to its customers.",2019
1789,"Instead of using one of the mega-cloud providers, they build a cloud to suit their specific use.",2019
1790,"These companies typically believe by controlling all the variables, software and the cloud, they can give customers a better experience and -- more than likely -- better pricing.",2019
1791,The most common examples of the purpose-built cloud are the data protection and disaster recovery as a service (DRaaS) examples.,2019
1792,"Companies like Acronis, Backblaze, Datto and Unitrends offer either cloud backup or DR.",2019
1793,The advantage of that kind of cloud service delivery model is it makes cloud connectivity about as seamless as one can find.,2019
1794,The other type of second-tier cloud vendor is the full-service cloud provider.,2019
1795,"Like the purpose-built provider, these vendors tend to focus on a particular market segment, but support a range of software instead of just one.",2019
1796,"In many ways, they are today's version of a storage reseller, enabling customers to pick or stay with the software product of their choice while they deliver back-end infrastructure and support.",2019
1797,"These providers make it easier to ""cloud-enable"" existing applications, so customers do not have to start all over again with native cloud applications.",2019
1798,"While most also focus on backup, DR and archive use cases, there is a growing contingent of companies in this space -- such as Iland, Iron Mountain and KeepItSafe -- that provide desktop-as-a-service functionality.",2019
1799,"The final type of second-tier cloud provider goes head-to-head against the big three, providing similar ""raw"" services like capacity and compute on demand.",2019
1800,"It may seem these providers take the most significant risk, directly competing with the mega-cloud providers; however, the reality is that many of them are very successful.",2019
1801,The cloud service delivery model and compute framework software required to compete for customers is readily available off the shelf.,2019
1802,"Additionally, these providers may have other advantages, such as proximity to the client or limits in which countries they replicate data.",2019
1803,The first step in selecting the right provider is for a business to assess its cloud skills.,2019
1804,"The more time or ability it has to develop those skills, the more appealing mega-cloud providers become.",2019
1805,"The fewer skills an organization has and the more crunched it is for time, the more appealing second-tier providers are.",2019
1806,"Selecting a provider type is largely dependent on those cloud skills as well, in addition to the level of flexibility desired.",2019
1807,"If an organization prefers its current software set, then a full-service provider can help cloud-enable it.",2019
1808,"If it doesn't have a preference, then purpose-built providers can potentially offer the ultimate turnkey cloud experience.",2019
1809,Reasons to go with the big three There are excellent reasons to select one of the primary cloud providers.,2019
1810,"First, all three -- AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud -- are closing the skills gap to make their services more accessible for traditional enterprises to use the cloud in some way.",2019
1811,"Like the tier 2 providers, most of these efforts to turnkey their services center on data protection, file sharing and archiving.",2019
1812,"They still require more cloud skills on the part of customers than with one of the more turnkey-oriented clouds, but these requirements are lessening.",2019
1813,"Another reason is that many software providers, instead of building their cloud, are using one of the primary public cloud providers to deliver cloud services.",2019
1814,"In most cases, the software developer manages the cost of the cloud so the customer only has to deal with a single bill.",2019
1815,"Finally, there is almost no risk of these providers running out of compute or cloud service delivery model resources.",2019
1816,"Reasons to go with a purpose-built cloud The primary reason to select a purpose-built cloud provider is impacted as much by the ""purpose"" of an organization's cloud as the cloud provider itself.",2019
1817,"Purpose-built cloud providers deliver turnkey solutions like DRaaS, cloud backup and cloud archive.",2019
1818,"As part of this, they provide their own software and cloud.",2019
1819,"The inclusion of all necessary components should make for a more seamless experience, but an organization has to want to use the provider's software and feel confident in its cloud.",2019
1820,"If a business is looking for a change in data protection or archiving software or wants to add new capabilities like DRaaS, then a purpose-built provider may make sense.",2019
1821,"If it wants to keep its current software, use a specific cloud provider or have the option to move to another provider in the future, then a purpose-built cloud may not make sense.",2019
1822,"Reasons to go with a full-service cloud Similar in many ways to purpose-built, the full-service provider offers a turnkey cloud, complete support and tends to specialize in a particular type of use.",2019
1823,Full-service providers are different in that they also support a wide range of on-premises software.,2019
1824,"There is a much better chance of a full-service provider supporting a customer's current software set than with a purpose-built provider, and the full-service cloud enables companies to take advantage of the provider's cloud expertise instead of forcing them to learn everything on their own.",2019
1825,The full-service cloud makes sense for those looking to retain monetary and knowledge investments in their current software.,2019
1826,It is ideal for organizations that like what they have and simply want to extend current applications to the cloud.,2019
1827,The software that moves data to the cloud is the customer's.,2019
1828,"One note of caution: Although moving from one full-service provider to a new one is possible, it is time-consuming and can be costly.",2019
1829,"Organizations considering a full-service cloud should make sure they are very comfortable with the data security and services available with the provider, as well as its long-term viability.",2019
1830,Be your own cloud Another option to consider is organizations being their own cloud.,2019
1831,The same economics and software that enables tier 2 providers to compete with the big three also enables enterprise IT departments to compete with tier 2 providers.,2019
1832,"Of course, this option requires businesses to build out their skill set as it relates to the cloud, but it has the potential payoff of them actually owning the investment instead of renting.",2019
1833,"If an organization's cloud strategy is multiyear, the cost to own is almost always cheaper than to rent.",2019
1834,Reasons to go with tier 2 IaaS Tier 2 infrastructure-as-a-service clouds typically do not provide any additional services over the big three.,2019
1835,Their primary advantage over the large cloud providers is price.,2019
1836,"There may also be some advantages in data center location, such as ensuring better data sovereignty and lower latency.",2019
1837,"However, a tier 2 IaaS provider lacks the physical size of the big three.",2019
1838,"In addition, the size of AWS, Google Cloud and Azure makes it almost impossible for them to run out of resources, both compute and cloud service delivery model.",2019
1839,"As long as a tier 2 IaaS provider manages its growth well, it should be able to provide unlimited resources.",2019
1840,But clients need to understand what provisions are in place to ensure resources won't become scarce in the future.,2019
1841,"With Windows Admin Center, you can view and control Windows Server hyper-converged infrastructure clusters, manage virtual compute, storage and network resources, and carry out a variety of other tasks.",2019
1842,"Windows Admin Center is available as a free, downloadable application that can run on Windows Server or Windows 10.",2019
1843,"Once installed, you can use Windows Admin Center's browser-based interface to connect to hyper-converged clusters locally or remotely without an internet connection.",2019
1844,"Introducing Windows Server HCI With the release of Windows Server 2016, Microsoft introduced hyper-converged infrastructure (HCI) capabilities that incorporate software-defined compute, storage and networking resources into a single Windows Server Datacenter cluster.",2019
1845,"The Windows Server HCI integration is based on three Windows Server technologies: Hyper-V, Storage Spaces Direct and software-defined networking.",2019
1846,Hyper-V is a hypervisor that virtualizes compute resources such as processors and memory and makes them available to one or more VMs running on the Hyper-V host.,2019
1847,"Each VM operates in its own isolated space, runs its own OS and includes the same basic components as a physical computer.",2019
1848,"Like most hypervisors, Hyper-V makes it possible to run different OSes and applications on the same machine without interfering with each other.",2019
1849,"Windows Server HCI also incorporates storage spaces direct, which virtualizes physical storage hardware to create a storage pool made up of drives from across the cluster.",2019
1850,Storage Spaces Direct can support up to 16 servers and more than 400 drives to deliver up to a petabyte of storage per cluster.,2019
1851,"When you add servers or drives to the HCI cluster, Storage Spaces Direct automatically onboards the new components and uses them right away.",2019
1852,"Storage Spaces Direct also incorporates such features as caching, storage tiers and erasure coding.",2019
1853,Storage Spaces Direct is the virtualized storage component of Windows Server.,2019
1854,"The final piece in the Windows Server HCI puzzle is software-defined networking (SDN), which virtualizes network hardware by abstracting physical resources such as routers, switches and gateways.",2019
1855,"With SDN, you can centrally manage both physical and virtual network devices, helping to speed up workload deployments and dynamically respond to evolving application requirements.",2019
1856,"In addition to these three main components, a Windows Server HCI cluster also incorporates Windows Server Failover Clustering services, which tie the servers together to provide load balancing and failover capabilities.",2019
1857,Failover Clustering also makes it possible to run workloads such as VMs on any server in the cluster.,2019
1858,"In addition, these HCI clusters can use Azure hybrid services to support such operations as monitoring or site recovery.",2019
1859,"Windows Admin Center is free, so administrators have little to lose by giving it a try.",2019
1860,"Social media has become a part of many people's daily routines, with billions of users regularly checking sites like Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.",2019
1861,Some of these users have started to adopt similar tools in the workplace as alternatives to traditional email-based communication.,2019
1862,"However, enterprise social networks can present challenges for HR managers and C-level executives if they are misused.",2019
1863,"Using enterprise social networks as personal social media sites

For companies using tools like Slack, Yammer or Microsoft Teams, it is not uncommon for employees to post messages or memes for non-work-related purposes.",2019
1864,This can be problematic for HR if an employee posts content a co-worker finds offensive.,2019
1865,"HR must work with IT to identify ways to restrict and filter some of the content being posted, which may not always be a feature available in the tools.",2019
1866,"Implementing data governance may be difficult

Modern collaboration tools have significantly changed the way we interact with content and each other.",2019
1867,"This is the result of a shift away from email to real-time messaging, along with audio/video communication capabilities and content sharing features that offer real-time co-authoring.",2019
1868,"The data enterprise social networks generate is different from traditional email messages and files, so applying existing policies can be more challenging when the data is locked inside applications like Microsoft Teams and Slack.",2019
1869,IT must learn new ways to implement security and retention policies using the features available in those apps.,2019
1870,"Limiting distractions

The obsession many of us have with checking our phones and email unfortunately tends to carry over into the workplace.",2019
1871,This is concerning to HR managers because it can affect staff productivity.,2019
1872,"However, tools like Slack and Microsoft Teams offer a do not disturb option that can block notifications for a specified period of time.",2019
1873,"Managing compliance

There are several compliance laws in the workplace around sexual harassment, bullying and the use of sensitive data.",2019
1874,"HR and IT may find themselves in situations where, after a reported incident, they are required to investigate a matter and determine if posted content broke one of these laws.",2019
1875,"IT can provide some assistance with content reviews, but not all enterprise social networks offer full access to employees' private messages.",2019
1876,"However, Microsoft Teams and Slack offer features that can assist with that.",2019
1877,"With the new communication tools employees use outside of work, email will continue to lose its effectiveness within organizations.",2019
1878,"The rise of platforms like Slack, Microsoft Teams and Yammer provide employees with a similar experience to what they already use in their personal life.",2019
1879,"But given the fast rate of adoption of enterprise social networks, HR and IT will have to implement policies and procedures to keep these tools from having negative consequences in the workplace.",2019
1880,"Skype classic holdouts are told to upgrade to version 8.0, as Skype 7.0 heads to the knackers yard

Microsoft has announced that Skype 7.0, otherwise known as Skype Classic, is being retired on 1 September.",2019
1881,Windows desktop users are being urged to upgrade to Skype version 8.0 in order to avoid loss of service.,2019
1882,"Skype version 8.0 was actually released back in October 2017 for Windows 7, 8 and Windows 10.",2019
1883,"But the redesigned interface, coupled with GIF support and easier media sharing as Microsoft sought to replicate the mobile experience on the desktop, proved to be unpopular among most Skype users.",2019
1884,"Upgrade now

This meant that Skype classic (version 7.0) had a large number of holdouts, but Microsoft in a blog posting has warned that they must upgrade by the start of September.",2019
1885,"“We are encouraging everyone to upgrade now to avoid any inconvenience as only Skype version 8.0 will work after September 1, 2018,” blogged Redmond.",2019
1886,"“As we roll out improvements, there comes a time when we must shut down older services and application versions.”

This is the remarkably similar message that Microsoft told Windows Phone users in 2017 when it halted Skype support on that platform, forcing Windows Phone holdouts to use competitor products such as WhatsApp.",2019
1887,"Microsoft for its part seems to recognise that not everyone is happy at the latest version of Skype, with users complaining of it being slow and somewhat bloated compared to quick and lean versions of the past.",2019
1888,"“This is done to ensure that all customers have the best possible Skype experience, and that there are no quality or reliability issues resulting from old technology and new technology interoperating,” Redmond insisted.",2019
1889,"“We know change can be hard, so we’re working to make the update as simple as possible.”

Skype version 8.0 does already offer free HD video and screensharing calls and the ability to share photos, videos, and other files (up to 300 MB at a time).",2019
1890,"New features

And Microsoft has now teased that version 8.0 will also get the following new features over the coming months, including read receipts (so you can see who has read your messages); private conversations (end-to-end encrypted Skype audio calls and send text messages or files); call recording; and group links to allow users to quickly get a group together on Skype.",2019
1891,"Furthermore, Skype version 8.0 is also rolling out on the Apple iPad and will include features such as quoted messages, personalised themes, chat list, and @mentions.",2019

1895,"Hyper-converged infrastructure continues to evolve, and with that evolution has come what industry insiders call HCI 2.0.",2019
1896,"This most recent iteration -- or, rather, iterations -- of hyper-convergence grew out of the shortcomings of previous hyper-converged systems.",2019
1897,Why HCI 2.0?,2019
1898,"First-generation hyper-converged infrastructure (HCI) systems bundle compute, storage and network resources into standardized nodes designed to work together under a common management layer.",2019
1899,"As well as it works, however, HCI 1.0 has its faults.",2019
1900,"Most notably, components often can't be upgraded independently of one another.",2019
1901,"If an organization needs to add storage, for example, it must buy additional nodes, which means paying for unneeded compute and network resources -- and, possibly, software licenses.",2019
1902,"Similarly, an organization running compute-intensive workloads could end up overpaying for storage.",2019
1903,The IT industry has yet to embrace a formal definition of HCI 2.0.,2019
1904,"Even so, next-generation hyper-converged systems aim to maintain the simplicity and the standardization first generation HCI is known for, while attempting to increase flexibility.",2019
1905,"In doing so, HCI is becoming more like composable infrastructure.",2019
1906,"Composable infrastructure is an IT architecture that enables system resources, such as compute, network and storage, to be disaggregated from hardware and placed in virtual pools of like resources.",2019
1907,That way users can treat those resources as software-defined services that can be allocated on an as-needed basis.,2019
1908,What's new in next-gen HCI?,2019
1909,"As with composable, HCI 2.0 vendors are increasingly disaggregating the hyper-converged system's storage and compute resources.",2019
1910,"Users of this new generation of hyper-converged products can upgrade storage independently of compute, for example, and they can manage the two independently, at least in some cases.",2019
1911,Some vendors are going a step further by enabling the use of external storage.,2019
1912,"DataCore has abandoned the phrase ""hyper-converged infrastructure"" in favor of ""hybrid-converged infrastructure,"" making the point that their HCI products can simultaneously use both integrated storage and external SAN storage.",2019
1913,"Similarly, Datrium has created a next-generation hyper-converged product that breaks the stack into performance and capacity tiers, thereby allowing users to manage storage at the VM level.",2019
1914,"This multitenant commercial building provides office and lab space for entrepreneurs, researchers and tech-sector employees to work, collaborate and unwind in one central location.",2019

1916,"The sleek, iridescent facade hints at the creativity occurring within Cortex while complementing the district’s mix of contemporary and historic architecture.",2019
1917,"Public amenity spaces designed to engage occupants and the public include a two-story atrium lobby, sit-down restaurant, grab-and-go market, full-service health club, and indoor and outdoor event and conference space.",2019

1940,"Examples of such tasks include audit data preparation, file organization, integration of data from multiple files, performance of basic audit tests in Excel, copying and pasting data, and manual annotations.",2019
1941,These tasks are not only time consuming and rule based; they are also prone to error.,2019

1943,"Robotic process automation (RPA) is software that interacts with other application software at the user interface level (i.e., in the same way as a human) and is used to automate processes that are structured, rule based, and repetitive, as well as those with machine-readable data.",2019
1944,RPA can automate tasks that are executed across different software applications.,2019
1945,Kevin Moffit et al.,2019
1946,"(“Robotic Process Automation for Auditing,” Journal of Emerging Technologies in Accounting, Spring 2018, http://bit.ly/2JKLCee) proposed that RPA can facilitate audit process automation.",2019
1947,This article uses a case study of an accounting firm’s employee benefit plan audits to demonstrate how RPA has the potential to improve audit quality.,2019
1948,Potential Applications of RPA to Audit Automation is not a new concept in auditing.,2019
1949,The innovation of RPA is that it offers the ability to connect otherwise unintegrated automated audit activities.,2019
1950,"For example, because RPA is an overlay software that resides on the presentation layer—that is, the layer of code that translates the program data into something a user can understand—it can be used to automate audit evidence collection activities.",2019
1951,Much of the audit evidence comes from a variety of sources and can be burdensome for auditors to collect.,2019
1952,"RPA can streamline audit evidence collection, and potentially preparation activities, by taking standardized data and combining it from different sources into one audit workpaper; as a result, RPA can execute audit tests that have been preprogrammed in other software applications, such as Excel or CaseWare IDEA (Moffitt et al.).",2019
1953,"In this manner, RPA can help auditors achieve near end-to-end audit process automation.",2019
1954,An RPA-enabled audit production line has implications for audit quality.,2019
1955,"Because RPA replaces the structured, time-consuming, and repetitive activities that auditors perform, the audit process should inherently be more efficient.",2019
1956,"In addition, as the auditors have more time to perform complex testing involving the investigation of accounting anomalies, the effectiveness of the audit will also improve.",2019
1957,Several frameworks for the application of RPA to auditing have been proposed (Moffitt et al.,2019
1958,"2018; Andrea Rozario, Three Essays on Audit Innovation, Rutgers University dissertation, 2019; Feiqi Huang, Three Essays on Emerging Technologies in Accounting, Rutgers University dissertation, 2019, http://bit.ly/2HFPk6E).",2019
1959,"These frameworks emphasize the need to thoroughly understand the process that is selected for RPA implementation; this makes it clearer which audit activities can be automated with RPA (i.e., the tasks that are structured, rule based, and repetitive) and whether the data that is needed to execute them is in a machine-readable format.",2019
1960,The activities identified as being automatable with RPA will need to be subdivided into discrete steps that can be translated into programmable functions.,2019
1961,RPA can streamline audit evidence collection by taking standardized data and combining it from different sources into one audit workpaper.,2019
1962,The next area of focus is the standardization of audit-relevant data.,2019
1963,"For RPA to be scalable and usable across many environments, data should contain consistent labels and be formatted identically.",2019
1964,"For example, different organizations might represent the last names of employees using different labels, such as “Employee Last Name,” “last name,” or “Payee last name,” causing hurdles in automation.",2019
1965,"By using a standard label (e.g., “Last_Name”), the format of this field can be standardized as text with maximum length of 100 characters (see Audit Data Standards, AICPA Assurance Services Executive Committee Emerging Assurance Technologies Task Force, August 2013, http://bit.ly/2VVwtbU).",2019
1966,Prototypes of the RPA solution can then be developed and tested to evaluate its success.,2019
1967,"Case Overview The subject of this case study, a public accounting firm headquartered in New York City, is one of the few national accounting firms that offers employee benefit plan (EBP) audit services.",2019
1968,"This firm annually audits more than 800 EBPs, ranging in size from 100 to 90,000 participants.",2019
1969,"Prior to the firm launching its automation project with the Rutgers Continuous Audit and Reporting Laboratory (CARLab), the EBP audits were extremely labor intensive and time consuming, especially in the substantive procedures phase, where auditors manually import audit data into Excel workbooks and perform various aspects of EBP testing, including writing and executing Excel functions and copying and pasting data from and to different tables.",2019
1970,"Defined contribution (DC) plan audits represent 88% of the firm’s total EBP audit engagements, and limited scope audits represent 93% of all DC plan engagements.",2019
1971,"In a limited scope audit, an auditor excludes procedures that otherwise would be performed on the investments, which typically are the most significant plan assets.",2019
1972,"Some of the significant accounts for testing are 1) contributions (employee, employer, and rollovers), 2) benefits paid, and 3) notes receivables from participants (loans).",2019
1973,RPA Prototype Development Project Identify objective.,2019
1974,"The objective of this automation project was to increase the efficiency and enhance the effectiveness of the limited scope defined contribution plan audits because the audit procedures in this type of engagement consist of labor-intensive, time-consuming, and repetitive testing.",2019
1975,Process identification.,2019
1976,"In this step, the authors looked into how each aspect of the substantive audit procedures in the limited scope DC plan audits was performed.",2019
1977,"The objective was to identify the tasks that are highly repetitive, simple, rule based, time consuming, and have machine-readable data.",2019
1978,"Based on discussions with the auditing firm, the authors decided to focus on the testing of eligibility, personal data, and employee loans.",2019
1979,"In this article, loan testing is used to illustrate the RPA prototype; the prototypes for other testing follow the same logic.",2019
1980,"In loan testing, loans to participants and the related interest are tested to determine whether the amounts due to the plan have been properly identified, valued, recorded, and disclosed in the financial statements.",2019
1981,Process understanding.,2019
1982,"Loan testing contained several audit activities that did not require audit judgment, were time consuming, and had to be executed across several audit engagements.",2019
1983,"These activities included the collection and preparation of audit evidence and the performance of rules-based audit tests, including the matching of loan amount balances and interest rates from one data source to the other.",2019
1984,"A review of audit workpapers and discussions of the EBP subject matter revealed that many loan testing activities could be automated using a combination of 1) Microsoft Access to program automated audit tests using basic Structured Query Language (SQL) and 2) RPA to collect audit evidence, then use RPA to execute the automated tests in Access.",2019
1985,Audit data standards.,2019
1986,"For the RPA to be scalable, it is important to develop an audit data standard, such as the AICPA standard referenced above, for the CPA firm’s own use.",2019
1987,This standard is essentially a template that contains consistent data labels and formats.,2019
1988,"Because sources of audit evidence that reflect the same values may label and format their data differently, the objective of this standard is for the CPA firm to maintain data in a consistent manner so that the RPA can work on numerous audit engagements.",2019
1989,"The audit data standard, which could be in the form of an Excel file, incorporates templates for a data dictionary, raw source data, data preparation, and its integrated structure.",2019
1990,The data dictionary tab describes the standard name of the audit data fields and maps it to name the data fields from the sources.,2019
1991,Part of the data dictionary developed in this case study is shown in Exhibit 1.,2019
1992,"For example, the “Participant Name” column from the report “Annual Loan Balance” and the “Payee” column from the report “Check Register” will all be converted to “Name” with the data type of “Text.” Exhibit 1 Excerpt of Data Dictionary Developed for the Employee Benefit Plan Audit The second template is an extract of the raw data from the sources, such as the company reports.",2019
1993,"The data preparation template links the data from the company reports and contains preprogrammed commands to process it, which could include the command to filter and trim the data.",2019
1994,"Finally, the integrated data structure tab reflects the standardized data.",2019
1995,An example of the standardized data (with simulated information) for the loan testing is shown in Exhibit 2.,2019
1996,Exhibit 2 Excerpt of Data Dictionary Developed for the Employee Benefit Plan Audit RPA prototype.,2019
1997,The proposed methodology to achieve near end-to-end automation for loan testing was to use Excel as the audit data standard and Microsoft Access as the tool to execute audit tests that match one data source to the other (Exhibit 3).,2019
1998,"As a result, the activities delegated to the RPA were collecting the data, bringing it into the standard template, activating filters to prepare it, and copying the integrated data structure to transfer it to Microsoft Access.",2019
1999,"Essentially, the RPA was used to automate the steps an auditor performs to import data from Excel to Access.",2019
2000,"Finally, the RPA executes the preprogrammed audit tests; accordingly, the auditor’s time is limited until the results of the tests are available.",2019
2001,"In addition, it is important to note that the event logs of the RPA software are available to check whether the process operates as expected.",2019
2002,Exhibit 3 RPA Prototype for Loan Testing Evaluation.,2019
2003,"The CARLab provided the RPA prototype to the CPA firm, and the firm is now experimenting with it and comparing it with alternative methods such as Visual Basic for Applications (VBA).",2019
2004,"Because an automation solution has not yet been fully deployed at this firm, parallel comparisons of the traditional method to the new cannot be made.",2019
2005,"Nevertheless, the authors conducted preliminary tests of the prototype’s usefulness to assess its value.",2019
2006,The evaluation of the prototype entailed an assessment of its efficiency and effectiveness.,2019
2007,"As to efficiency, RPA took less than one minute to execute the assigned tasks of collecting audit evidence and conducting audit tests on the complete population of accounting records—obviously less time than an auditor would spend conducting the same tasks.",2019
2008,"In addition, it is logical to assume that RPA will be more accurate in the performance of these relatively simple tests, which should lead to enhanced effectiveness.",2019
2009,"For example, the authors overstated the loan amount balance of a few transactions and restarted the RPA to test whether it would detect the anomalies; it detected them all.",2019
2010,"In addition, as auditors are able to allocate more time to more complex areas of the audit, it is reasonable to assume that more anomalies would be appropriately investigated.",2019

2297,The importance of this issue is underscored by the advances in scientific research during the past few years.,2020
2298,These findings make clear both that the average temperature on the planet has risen by 1 degree Celsius during the past 50 years and that carbon dioxide emissions have been a primary driver of this and this temperature increase.,2020
2299,"Indeed, if we fail to change substantially and quickly, there is a high risk that average temperatures will increase between another one and four degrees Celsius by the end of this century.",2020
2300,And the impact of such a temperature increase would be catastrophic.,2020
2301,A big part of the challenge is that as a society we have not committed sufficiently to reduce emissions.,2020
2302,"One conclusion we’ve reached is that we all need to learn – and get real – about “carbon math.” This is the basic mathematical concepts that are important to understanding how the carbon issue applies to each of us, whether as individuals, families, businesses, or other organizations.",2020
2303,One aspect of this is relatively simple but quite important.,2020
2304,"Scientists account for carbon emissions by classifying them into three categories, or “scopes.”

Scope 1 emissions are the direct emissions that your activities create — like the exhaust from the car you drive, or for a business, the trucks it drives to transport its products from one place to another or the generators it might run.",2020
2305,"Scope 2 emissions are indirect emissions that come from the production of the electricity or heat you use, like the traditional energy sources that light up your home or power the buildings owned by a business.",2020
2306,"Scope 3 emissions are the indirect emissions that come from all the other activities in which you’re engaged, including the emissions associated with producing the food you eat, or manufacturing the products that you buy.",2020
2307,"For a business, these emission sources can be extensive, and must be accounted for across its entire supply chain, the materials in its buildings, the business travel of its employees, and the full life cycle of its products, including the electricity customers may consume when using the product.",2020
2308,"Given this broad range, a company’s scope 3 emissions are often far larger than its scope 1 and 2 emissions put together.",2020
2309,This makes clear that we need to measure all three of these scopes.,2020
2310,"At Microsoft, we expect to emit 16 million metric tons of carbon this year.",2020
2311,"Of this total, about 100,000 are scope 1 emissions and about 4 million are scope 2 emissions.",2020
2312,The remaining 12 million tons all fall into scope 3.,2020
2313,"Given the wide range of scope 3 activities, this higher percentage of the total is probably typical for most organizations.",2020
2314,"YouTube Video Click here to load media

There’s another aspect of carbon math that’s also essential.",2020
2315,"This is the difference between being “carbon neutral” and being “net zero.” While they sound similar, in fact they’re different.",2020
2316,"Given common usage, companies have typically said they’re “carbon neutral” if they offset their emissions with payments either to avoid a reduction in emissions or remove carbon from the atmosphere.",2020
2317,But these are two very different things.,2020
2318,"For example, one way to avoid a reduction in emissions is to pay someone not to cut down the trees on the land they own.",2020
2319,"This is a good thing, but in effect it pays someone not to do something that would have a negative impact.",2020
2320,It doesn’t lead to planting more trees that would have a positive impact by removing carbon.,2020
2321,"In contrast, “net zero” means that a company actually removes as much carbon as it emits.",2020
2322,"The reason the phrase is “net zero” and not just “zero” is because there are still carbon emissions, but these are equal to carbon removal.",2020
2323,And “carbon negative” means that a company is removing more carbon than it emits each year.,2020
2324,"While we at Microsoft have worked hard to be “carbon neutral” since 2012, our recent work has led us to conclude that this is an area where we’re far better served by humility than pride.",2020
2325,"And we believe this is true not only for ourselves, but for every business and organization on the planet.",2020
2326,"Like most carbon-neutral companies, Microsoft has achieved carbon neutrality primarily by investing in offsets that primarily avoid emissions instead of removing carbon that has already been emitted.",2020
2327,That’s why we’re shifting our focus.,2020
2328,"In short, neutral is not enough to address the world’s needs.",2020
2329,"While it is imperative that we continue to avoid emissions, and these investments remain important, we see an acute need to begin removing carbon from the atmosphere, which we believe we can help catalyze through our investments.",2020
2330,"In addition, we’ve identified another shortcoming that we and many other companies need to overcome.",2020
2331,"Historically we’ve focused on Microsoft’s scope 1 and 2 emissions, but other than employee travel, we haven’t calculated as thoroughly our scope 3 emissions.",2020
2332,That’s why we’re committing to becoming carbon negative for 2030 for all three scopes.,2020
2333,"Taking responsibility for our carbon footprint

Based on this science and math, we’re launching today an aggressive plan to reduce Microsoft’s own carbon emissions.",2020
2334,It has three broad components.,2020
2335,"First, we will drive down our scope 1 and 2 emissions to near zero by the middle of this decade through the following steps:

By 2025, we will shift to 100 percent supply of renewable energy, meaning that we will have power purchase agreements for green energy contracted for 100 percent of carbon emitting electricity consumed by all our data centers, buildings, and campuses.",2020
2336,We will electrify our global campus operations vehicle fleet by 2030.,2020
2337,We will pursue International Living Future Institute Zero Carbon certification and LEED Platinum certification for our Silicon Valley Campus and Puget Sound Campus Modernization projects.,2020
2338,"Second, we will reduce our scope 3 emissions by more than half by 2030 through new steps, including the following:

In July 2020, we will start phasing in our current internal carbon tax to cover our scope 3 emissions.",2020
2339,"Currently this fee is $15/metric ton and covers all scope 1 and 2 emissions, plus scope 3 travel emissions.",2020
2340,"Unlike some other companies, our internal carbon tax isn’t a “shadow fee” that is calculated but not charged.",2020
2341,"Our fee is paid by each division in our business based on its carbon emissions, and the funds are used to pay for sustainability improvements.",2020
2342,"Starting in July, all our business divisions will also pay an internal carbon fee for all their scope 3 emissions.",2020
2343,"We will start at a lower price per ton than our current fee for other emissions, but we will phase in increases over time until all our scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions are charged the same rate.",2020
2344,This will both increase incentives across the company to reduce all scope 3 emissions and fund the added work to reduce our own scope 3 emissions and invest in carbon removal activities.,2020
2345,"By July of 2021, we will begin to implement new procurement processes and tools to enable and incentivize our suppliers to reduce their scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions.",2020
2346,We will work with our suppliers to implement consistent and accurate reporting and pursue effective steps to make progress against scientifically based targets.,2020
2347,"Third, by 2030 Microsoft will remove more carbon than it emits, setting us on a path to remove by 2050 all the carbon the company has emitted either directly or by electrical consumption since it was founded in 1975.",2020
2348,"We will achieve this through a portfolio of negative emission technologies (NET) potentially including afforestation and reforestation, soil carbon sequestration, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCs), and direct air capture (DAC).",2020
2349,Microsoft will form its carbon removal portfolio annually by assessing NET attributes pertaining to four criteria: (1) scalability; (2) affordability; (3) commercial availability and (4) verifiability.,2020
2350,"Given the current state of technology and pricing, we will initially focus on nature-based solutions, with the goal of shifting to technology-based solutions between now and 2050, when they become more viable.",2020
2351,"Investing for new carbon reduction and removal technology

Solving our planet’s carbon issues will require technology that does not exist today.",2020
2352,That’s why a significant part of our endeavor involves putting Microsoft’s balance sheet to work to stimulate and accelerate the development of carbon removal technology.,2020
2353,Our new Climate Innovation Fund will commit to invest $1 billion over the next four years into new technologies and expand access to capital around the world to people working to solve this problem.,2020
2354,"We understand that this is just a fraction of the investment needed, but our hope is that it spurs more governments and companies to invest in new ways as well.",2020
2355,We will primarily deploy this capital in two areas: (1) to accelerate ongoing technology development by investing in project and debt finance; and (2) to invest in new innovations through equity and debt capital.,2020
2356,"We’ll focus our funding on investments primarily based on four criteria: (1) strategies that have the prospect of driving meaningful decarbonization, climate resilience, or other sustainability impact; (2) additional market impact in accelerating current and potential solutions; (3) relevance to Microsoft by creating technologies we can use to address our unpaid climate debt and future emissions; and (4) consideration of climate equity, including for developing economies.",2020
2357,"In addition to this new fund, we will continue to invest in carbon monitoring and modeling projects through our AI for Earth program, which has grown over the past two years to support more than 450 grantees across more than 70 countries.",2020
2358,"Empowering customers around the world

We believe that Microsoft’s most important contribution to carbon reduction will come not from our own work alone but by helping our customers around the world reduce their carbon footprints through our learnings and with the power of data science, artificial intelligence, and digital technology.",2020
2359,"For many customers, sustainability is already a core part of their business, while others are just beginning their work to mitigate their carbon impact.",2020
2360,"Regardless of where organizations are on their journey, we’re committed to being of help.",2020
2361,Better tracking of carbon starts by creating greater transparency on the carbon impact of services and products.,2020
2362,"Today we’re launching a new tool, the Microsoft Sustainability Calculator that analyzes the estimated emissions from Azure services through a Power BI dashboard.",2020
2363,"This helps customers better understand the carbon impact of their cloud workloads, discover the potential benefits from fully migrating to Azure, and assists them in reporting their carbon footprint for IT services for the often hard-to-track Scope 3 emissions.",2020
2364,"We will follow this with new solutions and offerings that go further, including providing insight across Scopes 1, 2 and 3 and material circularity related to all Microsoft Azure services.",2020
2365,"We will also provide greater transparency on the carbon performance of Teams, Edge and other services and solutions.",2020
2366,This work builds on a foundation of science-based methodologies and transparency on environmental performance of our cloud infrastructure and supply chain.,2020
2367,We are also launching a new 24/7 matching solution with Vattenfall – a first-of-its-kind approach that gives customers the ability to choose the green energy they want and ensure their consumption matches that goal using Azure IoT.,2020
2368,"This new level of transparency can enable users to adjust their business operations to better fit the availability of the green energy they prefer, further decreasing their carbon footprint.",2020
2369,We are also committed to pursuing new partnerships with our customers to address carbon reduction.,2020
2370,"This will include co-innovating with customers and partners to develop low-carbon solutions, as we’ve done with L&T Technology Services, ABB, and Johnson Controls on sustainable smart building solutions capable of reducing energy consumption by 40 percent; embedding sustainability into our strategic alliances as we’ve pioneered with AT&T and NTT; driving cross-industry collaborations and coalitions to develop new standards and tools.",2020
2371,The significance and complexity of the task ahead is incredible and will require contributions from every person and organization on the planet.,2020
2372,"That’s why we are committed to continuing to work with all our customers, including those in the oil and gas business, to help them meet today’s business demands while innovating together to achieve the business needs of a net zero carbon future.",2020
2373,"Continued improvement in standards of living around the world will require more energy, not less.",2020
2374,"It’s imperative that we enable energy companies to transition, including to renewable energy and to the development and use of negative emission technologies like carbon capture and storage and direct air capture.",2020
2375,All this must be paired together to achieve the growing energy needs of an expanding global economy.,2020
2376,"Ensuring effective transparency

When it comes to carbon reduction, real progress requires real transparency.",2020
2377,"As we’re doing today, Microsoft will continue to disclose the carbon footprint of our services and solutions.",2020
2378,"We will support strong industry-wide standards for transparency and reporting on carbon emissions and removal, and we will apply these ourselves.",2020
2379,"Today we are also signing the United Nations’ 1.5-degree Business Ambition Pledge, and we hope many other companies will also join.",2020
2380,We will publicly track our progress in our annual Environmental Sustainability Report.,2020
2381,"Using our voice on carbon-related public policy issues

We will also use our voice to speak out on four public policy issues that we think can advance all of the world’s carbon efforts:

The need to expand global basic and applied research efforts on carbon, funded by governments, and reorient them towards targeted outcomes and enhanced cross-border collaboration to develop the breakthrough technologies needed to achieve net zero global emissions.",2020
2382,The removal of regulatory barriers to help catalyze markets to enable carbon-reduction technologies to scale more quickly.,2020
2383,The use of market and pricing mechanisms so people and businesses can make more informed carbon decisions.,2020
2384,The empowerment of consumers through transparency based on universal standards to inform purchasers about the carbon content of goods and services.,2020
2385,"Enlisting our employees

Finally, we’ll capitalize on the energy and intellect of our employees by inviting and encouraging them to participate in our carbon reduction and removal efforts.",2020
2386,"As we’ve found with Microsoft’s accessibility efforts, we believe that sustainability is a cause that is not only important to our employees, but an area where they can generate important insights and innovations across the company.",2020
2387,"We will create more opportunities for our employees to become actively involved, both in company-wide activities and in the work of their individual teams.",2020
2388,We’re launching today an expanded internal site where our employees can learn more.,2020
2389,Each year this work will culminate during our annual weeklong hackathon event that will include a specific focus and call for proposals on carbon reduction and removal.,2020
2390,"The world’s next moonshot

Reducing carbon is where the world needs to go, and we recognize that it’s what our customers and employees are asking us to pursue.",2020
2391,This is a bold bet — a moonshot — for Microsoft.,2020
2392,And it will need to become a moonshot for the world.,2020
2393,It won’t be easy for Microsoft to become carbon negative by 2030.,2020
2394,But we believe it’s the right goal.,2020
2395,"And with the right commitment, it’s an achievable goal.",2020
2396,"We will need to continue to learn and adapt, both separately and even more importantly in close collaboration with others around the world.",2020

2401,"Over the centuries, accountants have always focused on the economic or financial sphere of a company.",2020
2402,"Side effects resulting from economic activities, often referred to as ‘externalities’, were regularly ignored.",2020
2403,Externalities presented a challenge because they often had no price attached or could not easily be measured in a way that allowed for including them in financial accounting systems.,2020
2404,Ignoring those externalities was well accepted in a world that focused primarily on economic growth and the wealth of nations.,2020
2405,"But with a rising global population, side effects of economic productivity such as global climate change can no longer be ignored because the number of people and corporations affected by them has dramatically increased over the last years.",2020
2406,"A well-known example of those climate change effects is the drought in summer 2018, which forced the German chemical giant BASF to reduce production because of low water levels at the Rhine river.",2020
2407,"Other economic damage comes in the form of disruption caused by crises like climate-triggered migration

The Allianz risk barometer 2020 supports this view and lists the effects of climate change as one of the major business risks.",2020
2408,Slowly but surely the focus has shifted from a focus on the wealth of nations to a focus on the survival of nations on an increasingly devastated planet.,2020
2409,What is sustainability accounting?,2020
2410,"An important consideration in this respect was made in 2004 by HRH The Prince of Wales, who questioned whether the ‘traditional’ accounting tools are still appropriate to meet the new challenges and risks of the 21st century.",2020

3105,"Offer self-service HR When employees work away from the office, they typically may not have as much access to HR, including casual ways of reaching out such as walking to the HR department and asking a quick question.",2020
3106,"To rectify this, HR can offer self-service portals so employees can do more on their own, such as find answers to frequently asked questions.",2020
3107,Self-service HR tools can also cut down the time it takes for an employee to access their payroll and benefit information.,2020
3108,There are also systems that offer easy ways to request time off and submit expenses.,2020
3109,Open source forms the foundation of many data center and enterprise applications.,2020
3110,It has also become the preferred development methodology for cloud-native systems and networking software.,2020

3112,But what about open source hardware?,2020
3113,There are several reasons to think open source hardware infrastructure's time has come.,2020
3114,The Open Compute Project aims to bring the benefits of the open source software model to hardware infrastructure.,2020
3115,"It has long had the support of data center giants, and products developed under its auspices are starting to touch every part of the data center.",2020
3116,Why open source hardware -- and why now?,2020

3118,"However, the same sort of design sharing, component reuse and cooperative development has finally become feasible for hardware through several significant changes in both technology and the hardware supply chain, namely: The increased commodification of hardware , making the critical components of a server, storage array or network switch widely available from multiple merchant providers.",2020

3128,"Cloud operators like AWS, Facebook, Google and Microsoft are in the business of selling services, however, not hardware.",2020
3129,"Furthermore, the commodification of technology means their data center hardware rarely provides any differentiated advantages, which has led an increasing number of cloud operators to see the benefits of an open source hardware development model to better meet their collective needs.",2020

3159,What are your thoughts on concerns about this year’s strong growth (in areas like the cloud) being effectively “borrowed” from the future?,2020
3160,I always think it’s good to start with the facts.,2020
3161,Microsoft’s revenue growth for Q1 2021 – the quarter to September – was 12 per cent.,2020
3162,This compares with an average of 13.8 per cent over the past four years so where is this strong growth you mention?,2020
3163,"I know the question mentions the cloud in particular, and the Intelligent Cloud Division revenues were up 19 per cent in the latest quarter, but the four-year average growth rate for that division has been 18 per cent.",2020
3164,It’s hard to see any unusually strong growth in this period.,2020
3165,Maybe the addressable market is expanding faster than Microsoft’s revenues are growing.,2020
3166,"It certainly seems to be the case that the Covid pandemic has promoted unprecedented growth in the market as businesses have been forced to address digital transformation or perish, and remote working has become the norm in many cases.",2020
3167,"Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s CEO, says he thinks that tech spending will grow from about 5 per cent of GDP now to about 10 per cent over the next 10 years.",2020
3168,"I don’t know if he is right, but he seems to me to have a good grasp of the subject and recent events would seem to support this contention.",2020
3169,"If GDP grows at say 5 per cent a year nominal and Microsoft maintains its share of tech spending then it would grow at about 12.5 per cent a year, coincidentally the rate at which it is currently growing.",2020
3170,Maybe the next area of growth is the same as the current one.,2020
3171,"On Facebook (US:FB), what are your thoughts on the risks of it being broken up or more heavily regulated?",2020
3172,"More generally, is the quality of Facebook’s service deteriorating for advertisers?",2020
3173,We ask this in light of this year’s hate speech ad boycott and recent news that the company overestimated the reach of some ad campaigns.,2020
3174,Regulation doesn’t concern me much.,2020
3175,Increased regulation tends to cement incumbents in place as newcomers find it hard to comply.,2020
3176,The tobacco industry flourished for decades with tighter regulation.,2020
3177,"I am not saying a break-up couldn’t occur, but I believe the last break-up of a company in the US forced by antitrust action was AT&T in 1984.",2020
3178,"It produced the so called Baby Bells (the offspring of 'Ma Bell'-AT&T), which by 2018 had merged to form...AT&T.",2020
3179,Also as an investor it’s by no means clear that a break up into its constituent parts would destroy value.,2020
3180,Again let’s look at the facts.,2020
3181,The hate speech ad boycott was a non-event.,2020
3182,"Most advertisers did not participate, those who did only 'paused' their advertising rather than cancelling it indefinitely, and some of those who said they would boycott Facebook were, shall we say, misleading.",2020
3183,"Moreover, it is quite likely that other advertisers took advantage of the absence of their virtue signalling competitors to up their advertising spend.",2020
3184,"In its last quarter, Facebook’s revenue was up 22 per cent and ad impressions were up 35 per cent.",2020
3185,"It’s important to understand that Facebook’s advertising is more about enabling small businesses to advertise effectively than it is about the large corporate advertisers who were the ones who publicly announced their boycott, which was temporary if it happened at all.",2020
3186,Facebook’s top 100 advertisers only account for 16 per cent of Facebook’s revenues.,2020
3187,I regard the recent news about Facebook overestimating the time viewers spent watching videos in the same light.,2020
3188,Try to bear in mind when you read news about Facebook that most of the conventional media loathes and fears it in equal proportions.,2020
3189,"Your sustainable fund seems to take quite a common-sense approach, but what are the advantages and risks of factoring ESG into stock selection?",2020
3190,How useful are ESG ratings here?,2020
3191,There are several problems with factoring ESG into stock selection.,2020
3192,"One is that so many ESG approaches look at many of the most obvious factors, such as carbon footprint, hazardous waste, use of water, use of plastic, sources of energy, etc, but fail to take into account the fundamental and financial viability of the business.",2020
3193,"We think you should also look at things such as innovation, product development, revenue growth and return on capital.",2020
3194,"There is not much point in having a business that scores highly on conventional ESG factors, but that fails financially or in terms of its products or service.",2020
3195,Another problem I would suggest is a mindless box-ticking approach.,2020
3196,The mantra of ‘comply or explain’ too often gets transmuted into ‘just comply’.,2020
3197,"Take Philip Morris (US:PM), for example.",2020
3198,"We think it is making a major contribution to the welfare of smokers with its Reduced Risk Product, but we daren’t include it in our sustainable fund as it will just be met by people hissing ‘It’s a tobacco company’.",2020
3199,"Yes it is, but maybe it’s also part of the solution to conventional smoking.",2020
3200,It would be more productive to have a real debate.,2020
3201,"While you no longer focus on the day-to-day running of Fundsmith Emerging Equities Trust (FEET), it would be interesting to hear your current view on China as a region in which to buy shares following previous concerns.",2020
3202,"Has this view changed at all in the past few years, and how if so?",2020
3203,The concerns about investment in Chinese companies still remain.,2020
3204,The lack of real ownership rights in Variable Interest Entities through which you have to invest in Chinese online businesses.,2020
3205,There are incidences of poor accounting or outright fraud.,2020
3206,"Starbucks’ main competitor, Luckin Coffee, was recently exposed as a fraud.",2020
3207,"You need to accept that you are in partnership with the government and when there is a conflict of interest it is the interests of the government that will prevail, as we saw in the abortive Ant Group IPO.",2020
3208,"However, if you wish to tap the power of the Chinese economy I think investments there are best done through a vehicle in which investors recognise that they are accepting a different sort of risk to our main fund, like our emerging markets trust – Fundsmith Emerging Equities.",2020
3209,"Nowadays how widespread (or not) is creative accounting, and outright fraud, compared with when you wrote Accounting for Growth?",2020
3210,I think Wirecard answers that in a single word.,2020
3211,"Fundsmith Equity invests in a hugely liquid market, but there have been murmurs of concern that its size could potentially hinder performance in the future.",2020
3212,"Roughly speaking, is there a stage/fund size at which you would share such concerns, or even consider capacity constraints?",2020
3213,I think some of the obsession with size results from a failure to grasp how big the investment world is compared with the UK and the Fundsmith Equity Fund.,2020
3214,The fund invests in 30 companies with an average market capitalisation of £143bn.,2020
3215,If we owned 1 per cent of each – and 1 per cent is just a number I have chosen because hopefully we can agree that it is not a large or illiquid position – we would have a £42bn fund – so about twice its current size.,2020
3216,"We would not even get close to being in the top 10 funds by size in the United States, which is the main market in which we have invested to date.",2020
3217,"The stock that has contributed most to the performance of our fund is Microsoft, which is capitalised at $1.6 trillion, so size wouldn’t seem to have a been a problem there.",2020

3653,The eyes of traditional investors are widening to the landscape as well.,2021
3654,"It's an early-stage, sometimes loosely defined space, where many solutions remain unproven, but the long-term payoffs in terms of sustainability and cost reductions could be enormous.",2021
3655,"That's the hope of several early movers in circular economy investing, who shared their insights at the GreenBiz 21 virtual event in early February.",2021
3656,"Nestlé and Microsoft are among the noteworthy corporations putting considerable investments behind circular programs involving products and services, in service of their sustainability targets and with an eye to spark broader change across their industries.",2021
3657,"""I would almost challenge people to not think of it as, ‘I have to set up a fund separate from,’ but it's more of, ‘How do I set up our business to operate differently going forward?’"" said Anna Marciano, head of U.S. legal sustainability at Nestlé USA.",2021
3658,"""If we're going to make sure that we're using more recycled content, if we're going to ensure that we're going to reduce carbon emissions, then we need to be tracking that.",2021
3659,"So then our procurement team needs to be monitoring that and they need to be held accountable for all of our ESG commitments.""",2021
3660,"If you're going to use more recycled content, you're going to use alternative materials for packaging, you have to be ready to make the capital investment needed in your infrastructure in your factories.",2021
3661,"One goal of Closed Loop Partners (CLP), entering its ninth year, is to bring together institutional investors with strategic corporate investors who seek to build a circular economy for their supply chains while helping their sustainability goals.",2021
3662,"(CLP's private-equity Closed Loop Leadership Fund, launched in 2018, counts Nestlé, Microsoft and Nuveen among its investors.)",2021
3663,"""I have heard more in the last few years, probably than ever before, companies talking about investing off their balance sheets to achieve some of these goals, which I think is new vernacular for a lot of companies,"" said Bridget Croke, managing director at CLP.",2021
3664,"Nestlé's circular recipe

Also about one year ago, Nestlé launched its $2 billion sustainability fund, to support companies developing innovative packaging and recycling technologies through 2025.",2021
3665,(The company's first investment was in the Closed Loop Leadership Fund.),2021
3666,"The producer of coffee, candy and cocoa also created a nearly $260 million venture fund in support of planet-friendly packaging technologies.",2021
3667,Its broader sustainability targets include getting to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.,2021
3668,"Nestlé’s circular plans include, by 2025, reducing virgin plastics in packaging by one-third and making all of its packaging reusable and recyclable.",2021
3669,"But goals aren’t enough without something to back them up, Marciano said.",2021
3670,"""If you're going to use more recycled content, you're going to use alternative materials for packaging, you have to be ready to make the capital investment needed in your infrastructure in your factories,"" Marciano said.",2021
3671,"""And so it becomes really critical for this to be a mindset shift to say, yes, this is absolutely what we need to achieve.""",2021
3672,"Nestlé knew it had to invest in designing packaging for the future to meet its packaging commitments, so it established its Institute for Packaging Science in 2019 in Switzerland.",2021
3673,"One pocket-size result is new recyclable paper packaging for Smarties candies, popular in the U.K.

""That's really where the strong collaboration, the collective action of financial investments come into play,” Marciano added.",2021
3674,"”So we're really targeting investments to help transform the recycling infrastructure, so we could advance the circular economy at the end of the day.""",2021
3675,"Microsoft's circular formula

Similarly, as a corporate citizen, Microsoft aimed to look beyond the four walls of its own operations toward suppliers and customers, and other industries it touches, to enable circular markets to grow, said Brandon Middaugh, director of Microsoft’s Climate Innovation Fund.",2021
3676,"Like Nestlé, Microsoft also looks at translating its goals into circular economy action in terms of designing out waste, reusing and recycling materials and products, and replenishing natural resources that it uses — three pillars reflected by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.",2021
3677,"The investment strategy includes identifying and prioritizing the major areas of waste that apply to Microsoft's own supply chains and operations, including its devices, cloud infrastructure and campus operations, Middaugh said.",2021
3678,One new initiative is to build Microsoft Circular Centers to further the reuse of computer servers and other hardware from the company's data centers.,2021
3679,"""We really recognized that it was not enough to set the operational goal and to do that work internally.",2021
3680,"We needed to be partnering externally and reaching outside into the market to try to be an advance team for the innovation in the industry,"" she said.",2021
3681,"Microsoft is one year into its $1 billion, four-year Climate Innovation Fund.",2021
3682,"Carbon, water, waste and ecosystems are the core focus areas for the software juggernaut, which is aiming to carbon negative by 2030, removing all the carbon it has historically emitted by 2050.",2021
3683,"If you are not going to invest, what's the cost of not investing?",2021
3684,"The fund, a joint finance-sustainability initiative, is one of three balance-sheet ESG funds at Microsoft, in addition to others around affordable housing and racial equity.",2021
3685,"Middaugh said it’s useful to have a unified playbook toward a single goal, which may lean on products, operational investments, employee engagement and even advocacy, using partnerships in civil society.",2021
3686,"For Microsoft, the main points are about being carbon negative, water positive, zero waste — and building a ""planetary computer"" that harnesses artificial intelligence (AI) to recommend resource protection measures, tree by tree.",2021
3687,Tangible examples of these include reducing electronic waste and packaging hardware without waste.,2021
3688,"""Then it's also about giving the tools for traceability and transparency that we, our customers, need to be able to track circular economy themes,"" Middaugh said.",2021
3689,Those areas of strategic importance cascade to the investment strategy as well.,2021
3690,How to prove circular success?,2021
3691,"For traditional investors, sustainability with a sound return on investment is key, according to David Haddad, managing director and co-head of impact investing at Nuveen, a subsidiary of TIAA.",2021
3692,"""We want there to be an economic viability, because our time horizon tends to be relatively shorter than many of these larger companies.""",2021
3693,"And traditional institutional investors are challenged by the need to make a certain return within a relatively short time frame, maybe five or 10 years, which may not be enough for a market to mature.",2021
3694,"Ways to reduce the risk around investments can include investing in research and innovation; proving that new business models are moving in a certain direction and integrating that into the business; and exploring longer-term contracts, according to Croke.",2021
3695,"Nestlé’s sustainability fund is already driving results, said Marciano, who is also division general counsel for Nespresso USA and International Premium Waters.",2021
3696,"""We have access to more recycled plastic already, we're able to integrate it into our Stouffer’s business, into our Coffee mate business, into our water business,"" she said.",2021
3697,"""So we see it working already.",2021
3698,"And it's only been a few months in.""",2021
3699,"Middaugh noted that Microsoft focuses on metrics around the use of recyclable materials; landfill diversion in terms of solid waste and the construction and demolition waste at its campuses, and an overlapping focus on embodied carbon.",2021
3700,"""And in terms of how we integrate those with the rest of the decision process.",2021
3701,"It's really around assessing the impact, assessing the risk and then looking for that impact and risk-adjusted return,"" she said.",2021
3702,"For Nestlé, measuring circular economy success involves improving recycling rates beyond the company itself by spurring improvements in recycling infrastructure more broadly, encouraging consumers to recycle too.",2021
3703,But that’s tricky.,2021
3704,"The question of measuring social impacts, not just the environmental ones most companies have prioritized, is another matter.",2021
3705,"Haddad noted that as an impact investor, there’s no cookie-cutter recipe, but Nuveen works closely with each young company to determine relevant metrics, and any failure to be able to report on those alongside financial performance will make it a no-go for funding.",2021
3706,"Croke agreed that limited tools for tracking certain metrics related to circular goals are difficult for companies or municipalities, but a bonus to working with large tech companies is being able to identify and address data gaps and useful technologies.",2021
3707,"Partnerships and collaborations are essential

How does a sustainability advocate make the business case for investing toward circular, sustainable solutions?",2021
3708,What’s the benefit of leveraging the company’s balance sheet or other capital?,2021
3709,Early corporate movers may offer useful examples.,2021
3710,Croke noted that some companies may find it hard to identify such investment opportunities and run up against limits to the size of deals they can take on.,2021
3711,"""And so the ability to invest through other funds helps sometimes open up opportunities to invest in things that might be too early-stage or small that need some de-risking,"" Croke said.",2021
3712,"Partnerships with third-party leaders can help when trying to apply lessons to the rest of the business from initiatives around circular servers, recycling and reuse, Middaugh said.",2021
3713,"She, Marciano and Croke agreed that no organization should try to go it alone when addressing a systemic challenge as large as growing a circular economy.",2021
3714,"For example, it’s upon Nestlé to share its expertise in sustainable packaging, collaborating with other stakeholders to make sure it’s not introducing harmful materials into products.",2021
3715,Such relationships can improve the wheel in multiple areas.,2021
3716,And policy advocacy is another spoke of the wheel for Nestlé.,2021
3717,Middaugh added that collaborations should involve early-stage innovations and pilots — such as sharing information with other companies exploring advanced materials — as well as later-stage infrastructure buildout.,2021
3718,"Microsoft is working with suppliers to update its supplier Code of Conduct to reflect its carbon and sustainability goals, also providing the tools to help its partners meet their goals.",2021
3719,"The coming transition

CLP draws connections across that ecosystem by backing circular efforts by municipalities, recycling facilities and material recovery facilities (MRFs).",2021
3720,"It has invested, for example, in Amp Robotics, which offers early-stage AI for recycling facilities, and PureCycle Technologies, whose technology turns polypropylene back into virgin-quality material.",2021
3721,CLP started an innovation hub to support pre-competitive ideas.,2021
3722,"Croke agreed that data points around diversion of material and greenhouse gas impacts, to name just a couple, are relatively simple to understand.",2021
3723,"""What I think is sometimes more interesting, and a little bit harder to measure is the catalytic impact that's being had, we're all trying to completely transform a supply chain, the way that the supply chain works from being linear to being circular, and the linear supply chain is quite scaled,"" she said.",2021
3724,"""The economics are very efficient today.""",2021

4102,"Exchange Online, for example, has one size limit for user mailboxes and a different size limit for resource mailboxes.",2021
4103,Exchange Online Organizations need to pay most attention to the Exchange Online limits associated with mailboxes because that's where the bulk of the data resides.,2021
4104,"For example, in the Office 365 Enterprise E1 plan, user mailboxes are limited to 50 GB.",2021
4105,That limit doubles to 100 GB for those with an Enterprise E3 or E5 subscription.,2021
4106,Organizations with Enterprise plans also receive archive mailboxes for each user.,2021
4107,"In the case of the Enterprise E1 plan, the archive mailboxes have a 50 GB limit.",2021
4108,Archive mailbox sizes in the Enterprise E3 and E5 plans are unlimited.,2021
4109,"However, Enterprise E3 and E5 mailboxes initially only receive 100 GB of archive mailbox space.",2021
4110,"Assuming that the business enables auto expansion, the archive mailboxes will grow to accommodate as much archive data as is necessary.",2021
4111,"In addition, Microsoft 365 storage space is sometimes based on the presence or absence of a license.",2021
4112,"For example, shared mailboxes and resource mailboxes do not require a license, although users need a client access license to access these mailboxes.",2021
4113,"If unlicensed, however, such mailboxes are limited to 50 GB.",2021

4122,"Although a site can accommodate 25 TB of data, it does not mean that users have 25 TB of storage capacity.",2021
4123,The subscription plans include 1 TB of storage space that all of the organization's sites must share.,2021
4124,"However, Microsoft adds 10 GB of space for each user that an organization licenses.",2021

4127,Microsoft Viva is getting a new module -- objectives and key results -- to set and track goals from organizations to individuals.,2021
4128,But something that seemed to get more attention at the vendor's Ignite conference this week was Viva's employee privacy rules.,2021
4129,"Viva, which Microsoft describes as an employee experience tool, can present employees with an analysis of their workday based on scans of their emails, calendars, Teams activity and other inputs collected by Microsoft 365.",2021
4130,"That kind of data collection and analysis may make some workers wonder how their employer plans to use such information, and, if the HR department fails to provide clarity, may create a risk for the company.",2021
4131,"Brian Kropp, chief of research in the Gartner HR practice, said employers need to communicate to their employees that they only plan to see aggregate employee data.",2021
4132,"If they don't do that, they may see employee disengagement, turnover and face the possibility that employees will start working ""outside the system because they don't want to be monitored and tracked,"" he said.",2021
4133,That fear may explain why some of Microsoft's presenters at Ignite highlighted and carefully explained Viva's privacy protections.,2021
4134,"""When we talk about private personal insights, we truly mean private,"" said Erik Anderson, a Microsoft group program manager, speaking at Ignite.",2021
4135,"""Personal insights that are surfaced to an individual are only for that individual themselves.",2021

4137,"Objectives and key results app The objectives and key results (OKR) app comes from Microsoft's recent acquisition of Ally.io, an OKR app developer.",2021
4138,The OKR function is Microsoft Viva's fifth module in its employee experience platform.,2021
4139,"The other four modules are: Learning, a personalized learning feature; Topics, which sorts organizationally important information; Insights, which gathers data from emails, meetings, calls and chats to help employees assess productivity and well-being; and Connections, a communications tool.",2021
4140,"The OKR app module will have a central hub for individuals, teams and departments to access and update goals, review progress and see a shared view of the team's priorities, said Seth Patton, general manager of Microsoft 365 and Viva product marketing, at the virtual conference.",2021
4141,"""When people see how they're making an impact, and when they're aligned with the rest of their team, they stay engaged and achieve better results,"" Patton said.",2021
4142,The kind of monitoring capability available in Viva has gotten more attention by HR departments since the push to remote work due to COVID-19.,2021
4143,Kropp described Viva as both an employee surveillance tool and a productivity enhancement tool.,2021
4144,"It can enhance productivity by reminding employees, for instance, that they need to get something done by a particular date.",2021

4158,"Keeping PCs humming boosts employee productivity, a hot topic among companies managing remote workforces during the pandemic.",2021
4159,Microsoft shifted the focus of Productivity Score to software and hardware performance after privacy advocates claimed companies could use the first iteration to track the activities of remote workers.,2021
4160,Changes Microsoft made in December removed end-user names to collect only aggregate data.,2021
4161,"At the time, the company claimed it never meant for the tool to measure the productivity of individuals.",2021

4386,"A little-known bit of corporate climate trivia that might have slipped under your radar: In early 2020, before the COVID-19 pandemic paralyzed the world, Microsoft began work to establish a separate corporate office in New York City dedicated to liaising with the United Nations.",2022
4387,"The vision, as Microsoft’s vice president of U.N. affairs John Frank explained in October 2020, is ""to engage with the UN community, build relationships and learn, and help make Microsoft’s partnerships more impactful.""",2022
4388,"Last week, the company used that office as the stage to outline its latest initiatives aimed at addressing climate change.",2022
4389,"The company’s agenda has grown increasingly sophisticated in the almost three years since it declared its intention to become ""carbon negative.""",2022
4390,"During the Climate Week briefing, the company’s vice chair and president Brad Smith underscored Microsoft’s threefold agenda: getting its own house in order with respect to carbon emissions and other climate-related concerns, including water consumption; fostering digital technology that the world needs to build a more sustainable future; and supporting efforts to nurture societal changes — skills, markets and laws — that support the just transition to a clean economy.",2022

4402,"The first centered on a collaboration with nonprofit TerraPraxis, centered on helping coal plant operators determine the best ways to retrofit their facilities to run on carbon-free energy.",2022
4403,"The idea is to create a replicable way for gathering data to help more than 2,400 coal plants be reconfigured to run nuclear power.",2022

4421,"When it comes to carbon, Microsoft’s commentary focuses on reporting regulations, as well as policies instrumental for removal and reduction.",2022

When it comes to reporting, the company advocates ""consistent, robust and interoperable GHG reporting metrics,"" flexibility of disclosure requirements and recognition of the role new technologies will play in tracking and calculations.",2022

4450,"And as U.N. Secretary General António Guterres said at COP27, the “deadly impacts of climate change are here and now.” This means the world must not only push harder toward the goal of a Net Zero economy by the middle of the century, but move quickly and aggressively, especially in the Global South, to help vulnerable populations adapt to a world with a changed climate.",2022

Foreword

It’s hard to ignore the effects of climate change.",2022
4638,"In recent weeks, a heavy blanket of smoke from nearby wildfires has enveloped the region I call home, an eerie phenomenon that has become an unfortunate seasonal event in the Pacific Northwest of the United States.",2022
4639,"At the same time, the American West and parts of Europe are experiencing historic drought.",2022
4640,"And halfway around the world, Pakistan is recovering from catastrophic summer floods that killed 1,500 people, displaced 33 million more and caused $40 billion in ruin.",2022
4641,All devastating events.,2022
4642,And all believed to be fueled by climate change.,2022
4643,"The gravity of the problem has led more than 3,900 companies, including Microsoft, to announce climate pledges.",2022
4644,"As we work, internally and with a large majority of these companies, it’s clear that the coming business changes will be massive.",2022
4645,"They will impact a wide variety of processes and operations, in part based on new applications for digital technology, including cloud services, AI and dedicated services like our Cloud for Sustainability.",2022
4646,"But, as we’ve learned, this will also require an equally vital effort to equip companies and employees with a broad range of new skills needed for climate adaptation and sustainability transformation.",2022
4647,The historical importance and current breadth of the sustainability skilling challenge are difficult to overstate.,2022
4648,A clear analogy has emerged from our study of the issue.,2022
4649,Humanity’s initial quest to reach the moon required the spread of physics into a broadly accessible academic discipline across the United States.,2022
4650,The world’s entry into the digital age then required that computer science move into every school.,2022
4651,"In a similar way, the creation of a net zero planet will require that sustainability science spreads into every sector of the economy.",2022
4652,That’s the focus of this report.,2022
4653,"During the past year, Microsoft and Boston Consulting Group (BCG) studied the work of 15 companies at the forefront of sustainability innovation and change – including across Microsoft itself.",2022
4654,Our teams interviewed or surveyed nearly 250 employees whose jobs have sustainability commitments.,2022
4655,We identified new jobs that have emerged.,2022
4656,We studied the impact on the many jobs that existed before.,2022
4657,And we considered what our data says about in-demand knowledge and skills.,2022
4658,The impact on jobs across companies falls into two broad categories.,2022
4659,The first is specialized sustainability positions emerging quickly across the global economy.,2022
4660,"For example, a company like Microsoft now employs individuals who pursue full time the purchase of long-term, high-quality carbon removal.",2022
4661,"The second is much broader, as existing jobs expand to encompass sustainability subject matter.",2022
4662,A good example involves engineers and materials scientists who design hardware devices.,2022
4663,They now have to assess not only the capabilities of materials that go into a new device but also the sustainability implications of those materials.,2022
4664,"As companies move to create and fill these jobs, they are confronting a huge sustainability skills gap.",2022
4665,This gap encompasses three categories.,2022
4666,"First, some employees need deep and specialized sustainability knowledge and skills in areas like carbon accounting, carbon removal and ecosystem services valuation.",2022
4667,This includes the skills needed to address these issues through new climate-specific digital tools.,2022
4668,"Second, broader business teams need readier access to more limited but sometimes deep knowledge in specific sustainability subject areas, such as climate-related issues that have become important for procurement and supply chain management.",2022
4669,"Third, a great many employees need basic and broader fluency in sustainability issues and climate science fields that impact a wide variety of business operations and processes.",2022
4670,"Ultimately, it’s important to recognize that the sustainability transformation will need people who can combine specialized sustainability knowledge and skills with varying degrees of other multidisciplinary skill sets.",2022
4671,"These will need to combine knowledge from STEM and other fields in the liberal arts and encompass skills that span across business, the use of data, and digital technology.",2022
4672,This combination currently is hard to find and often doesn’t exist naturally.,2022
4673,"Perhaps unsurprisingly, we’ve also learned that the sustainability skills gap is creating an increasing sense of anxiety for business leaders.",2022
4674,This reflects not only the enormity of the climate crisis but two other factors as well.,2022

4885,"At Microsoft, for instance, we publish all our supplier non-compliance data from within our devices manufacturing supply chain.",2022
4886,We also provide an Eco Profile that shows the full life cycle impact of every one of our devices.,2022
4887,"But when we talk about sustainability, I think it’s critical we don’t just talk about the environment but also issues like modern slavery and living wages.",2022
4888,"For the average company procuring goods, what are the risks of inadvertently becoming involved with human trafficking or another form of modern slavery?",2022
4889,"Sian: Certainly, there is a risk.",2022
4890,That’s partly due to poor visibility within supply chains.,2022
4891,"Unfortunately, the nature of audits and assessments means you might not actually detect some of these issues, even if you think you have visibility.",2022
4892,"In some industries, suppliers are used to being audited and may be conscious to hide certain things, which could be due to a sense of being policed, rather than being collaborated with.",2022
4893,The nature of these crimes can also make them really difficult to detect.,2022
4894,We should always remember that modern slavery is on a spectrum.,2022
4895,"It can manifest in very extreme ways, or in smaller things; for example, an employer might withhold somebody’s original documentation or passport.",2022
4896,There might be threatening or coercive behaviour at work that an audit wouldn’t necessarily be able to detect.,2022
4897,"So, there are some aspects of modern slavery that might not seem to meet the definition by itself.",2022
4898,"But when considered together, they signify that something is very wrong and that an employee’s freedom to leave the employer is restricted.",2022
4899,"Dave: We as organisations continually push the businesses we buy from to increase productivity and reduce costs, and these measurements of success are actually contributing to the problem.",2022
4900,"But we need to understand that if we continue the race to the bottom, we might be contributing to modern slavery.",2022
4901,I’d like to talk about the related question of fair pay.,2022
4902,How do we maintain oversight of this when it comes to our supply chains?,2022
4903,Sian: EY is a Living Wage Employer in the UK.,2022
4904,"This means paying directly employed staff an independently recognised, real living wage, and extending that to subcontracted staff where there’s a greater risk of low pay.",2022
4905,"While more organisations are focusing on this, there is still a huge gap.",2022
4906,"Partly, that’s because real Living Wage rates haven’t actually been identified yet in certain countries, regions and industries.",2022
4907,In the UK you can contact the Living Wage Foundation for more information about becoming a Living Wage Employer in the UK.,2022
4908,"In the US, there is a relatively new organisation called Living Wage For US and with partners, the Global Living Wage Coalition has identified a real Living Wage in many locations and industries to help drive progress.",2022
4909,Dave: We’re also focusing on this at Microsoft.,2022
4910,"In the past year alone, audits of our devices manufacturing facilities have enabled us to identify and repay US$1.5 million in past insufficient payments to over 36,000 workers.",2022
4911,"But of course, there’s more to this story than mitigating negative impacts – we can also take proactive steps to increase our positive impact.",2022
4912,Buying from a more diverse range of suppliers is one of the ways we’re trying to ensure we have a positive impact on communities where we operate.,2022
4913,I know you do the same at EY.,2022
4914,"Do you think that, in general, businesses are becoming more aware of the need to procure from a diverse range of suppliers?",2022
4915,"Amy: I’ll take this one, because it’s something I deal with on a daily basis.",2022
4916,We’re definitely seeing more companies strengthen and expand their ESG programs and review their procurement processes with supplier diversity in mind.,2022
4917,Various factors seem to be driving this.,2022
4918,"It can be shareholder or employee expectations, or the need to diversify supply chains due to disruption.",2022
4919,"It can also come from a desire to include suppliers from particular minority groups, such as buying from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander–owned or women-owned businesses.",2022
4920,"Whatever the drivers, supplier diversity is no longer a ‘nice-to-have’.",2022
4921,Now it’s a ‘must-have’ for companies that want to operate in today’s world.,2022
4922,"At EY, a lot of our focus on supplier diversity is driven by client expectations.",2022
4923,"Dave: Too often, I see procurement people focus on inclusion for compliance reasons.",2022
4924,"What I love about EY and Microsoft, though, is that we do this work because it’s part of our purpose.",2022
4925,"In your role, how do you try to open up inclusive economic opportunities within the communities that you buy from?",2022
4926,Amy: I’m really fortunate to be in a role where my sole purpose is just to seek diverse suppliers and businesses for opportunities in our supply chain.,2022
4927,"I work closely with various advocacy organisations such as Supply Nation (of which Microsoft is also a member), looking for businesses that meet our requirements here at EY.",2022
4928,"But the best part of my role is finding ways for EY, as a professional services firm, to provide support to these businesses.",2022
4929,We’re developing some really brilliant programs and workshops that help our teams share their knowledge.,2022
4930,"So, inclusion is part of our DNA.",2022
4931,It’s embedded into our global procurement policy and our day-to-day work.,2022
4932,"We make sure that message is driven from the top – our leaders make it very clear that supplier diversity is not an additional part of what our supply chain team does, it’s what we all need to do to create that impact on our communities.",2022
4933,"Dave: Another really important thing we’ve noticed at Microsoft, particularly during COVID-19, is that many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander–owned or women-owned businesses and social enterprises are generally more agile, and can adapt quickly and more efficiently than most large multinational organisations.",2022
4934,"Before we wind up, I’d like to zoom in on our own relationship.",2022
4935,"Obviously, EY is our customer and one of our partners.",2022
4936,"But we also have a strategic relationship, pooling our technology and your business ingenuity to provide better services to our customers.",2022
4937,How do you think our shared values help us both be better suppliers to our own customers and partners?,2022
4938,Sian: Absolutely.,2022
4939,"Obviously, it’s incredibly important that both Microsoft and EY have such strong focus on ESG internally as the companies are customers to one another.",2022
4940,"Our shared carbon reduction goals are particularly important, especially given Microsoft’s desire to help their own suppliers reduce emissions.",2022
4941,"At EY, we’re already carbon negative.",2022
4942,We’re now helping our suppliers on this journey as well.,2022
4943,"Amy: As large multinational companies, we really do have an ability to effect change and exert influence.",2022
4944,The best thing about our collaboration has been having those shared values.,2022
4945,We’re both committed to the same positive outcomes and we’re able to use our partnership to amplify our impact.,2022
4946,What began as transactional has really unlocked a lot of social value – it’s been fantastic.,2022
4947,"At Microsoft ANZ, our commitment to responsible sourcing goes beyond compliance.",2022
4948,"We understand that the success of our business, today and tomorrow, depends on our ability to build a supply chain that’s sustainable in every sense of the word – for the planet and for people.",2022

5076,"In her new role, Nakagawa will lead Microsoft’s company-wide environmental sustainability work, including initiatives towards reaching its 2030 targets to become carbon negative, water positive and zero waste while contributing to biodiversity, as well as its efforts to deliver technology to help customers and partners achieve their own sustainability goals, and to partner with governments, nonprofits, and businesses to help accelerate broader global sustainability progress.",2022
5077,"In a blog post announcing the new appointment, Brad Smith, Vice Chair and President of Microsoft, said:

“Melanie joins Microsoft at a critical time.",2022
5078,January will mark the third anniversary of our ambitious climate goals to be carbon negative by 2030 and remove our historical carbon emissions by 2050.,2022
5079,"While I’m pleased with our progress, we must accelerate our momentum and broaden even further our climate-related work.”

Nakagawa joins Microsoft after serving in the Biden administration White House as Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director for Climate and Energy on the National Security Council, where she played a leadership role on international and domestic climate initiatives, including working on the U.S.’ return to the Paris Agreement, and on energy issues including the international energy response to the war in Ukraine.",2022
5080,"She also served as Deputy Assistant Secretary for Energy Transformation at the U.S. State Department under the Obama administration, responsible for supporting the shift toward a low carbon economy.",2022
5081,"From 2017 through 2020, Nakagawa worked as Director of Climate Strategy for climate tech-focused private equity firm Princeville Capital.",2022
5082,"In a social media post following the announcement, Nakagawa said:",2022
5083,"Brooke Rose and Brian Patrick Green

Brooke Rose, a 2021-22 Environmental Ethics Fellow, and Brian Green, director, technology ethics, both at the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics.",2022
5084,Views are their own.,2022
5085,"Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) investing is a way for companies to demonstrate their commitment to a more just and sustainable world.",2022
5086,"While the ESG movement is an admirable step in the right direction, ESG is still a young field with much development ahead of it.",2022
5087,For ESG to achieve its full potential it should be expanded to include more diverse perspectives and beliefs about the ethical importance of the planet and differing conceptions of how resources ought to be shared.,2022
5088,What could ESG become if it considered what it looked like for the Earth to belong to everyone?,2022
5089,"ESG, which has emerged among Western notions of property rights, resource use, and consumerism, should take differing understandings of ownership into account so that corporations and their investors are more fully aligned with the ethical expectations of the societies in which they operate.",2022
5090,"By considering diverse views of environmental ownership and responsibility, ESG can become a truly global movement and thereby do even more for the world’s transition towards a more equitable, sustainable future.",2022
5091,"Current Relationship Between Business and Planet

Since the industrial revolution, the relationship between humans and the environment has been rapidly deteriorating.",2022
5092,"Businesses have prioritized profit over the planet and people, exploiting the Earth and fellow human beings in order to extract resources and labor.",2022
5093,"Most of current environmental degradation comes from the hands of those in the Global North, who through colonization and current neo-colonial efforts have often taken more than their fair share of resources.",2022
5094,Unjust business practices are resulting in current environmental issues and human rights violations.,2022
5095,"Companies like Adidas and H&M are still using sweatshop labor to produce their products, which are infamous for their deplorable working conditions, use of child workers, and use of harsh chemicals that affect water safety [1].",2022
5096,The Carbon Majors Report found that 100 companies are responsible for 71% of greenhouse gas emissions [2].,2022
5097,"Greenhouse gas emissions are causing climate change, which in turn results in rising sea levels, reduced resilience to natural disasters, and damage to food production.",2022
5098,ESG can provide a sort of moral compass for companies as they reach towards greater environmental sustainability and social justice goals.,2022
5099,"However, ESG is still limited in its cultural perspective and could do more in order to be broadly inclusive of other perspectives.",2022
5100,"With these improvements, ESG can act as an ethical facilitator between business, consumer, and planet.",2022
5101,"Beliefs and Theories in Favor of the Environment

ESG has been growing in popularity because both employees and consumers are demanding it.",2022
5102,"This is no surprise, because there are plenty of reasons for humans to care about the well-being of the environment.",2022
5103,"All the major religions, and many other worldviews, have some sort of connection to nature and guidelines on environmental stewardship.",2022
5104,"Many social theories, cultures, and psychological studies also indicate the importance of caring for our environment.",2022
5105,"Indigenous Australian Practices

Indigenous cultures across the world hold a reverence and care for the environment that stands in opposition to much of today’s industrialized and commercialized world.",2022
5106,A group of researchers working with indigenous Australian groups learned about the practices and beliefs of these communities in order to improve natural resource management in the area.,2022
5107,"They found five guiding principles that drove community members to think about the environment and use its resources: 1) the connection between the environment and people of past and present, 2) ancestral traditions about environmental stewardship, 3) union with the environment, 4) dependence on the environment for human health and well-being, and 5) the importance of sustainability to ensure it can continue providing sustenance [3].",2022
5108,"The use of these eco-centric principles in this indigenous community indicates the importance of respecting the environment, and how human lives are connected to the well-being of the planet.",2022
5109,These indigenous principles are relevant for ESG because they incorporate longer time horizons and convey human connectedness to the environment rather than separation.,2022
5110,"Hinduism

There are many ideas in Hinduism that advocate for caring about the environment.",2022
5111,"Many Hindus believe that humans and nature coexist, and that one cannot destroy nature without destroying humans too [4].",2022
5112,Karma and reincarnation are two ideas central to Hinduism.,2022
5113,"Karma, which is the belief that all actions bring consequences, is related to reincarnation because the law of karma can apply to many lifetimes: if people do negative things in this life, it may impact their next reincarnation.",2022
5114,These beliefs can help encourage Hindus to accept responsibility for how they treat the environment.,2022
5115,"Christianity

Within Christianity, one concept that stands out is “the universal destination of goods.” In Catholic social teaching, the universal destination of goods refers to how the goods of creation were made for the benefit of all of humankind.",2022
5116,"This idea comes from the creation story of Genesis 1, where it is detailed how God created both Earth and humans, giving the Earth to humans so they might have dominion over it and enjoy its fruits.",2022
5117,"According to Pope John Paul II, God gave the Earth to the whole of humanity, without favoring or excluding anyone, and that the Earth “is God's first gift for the sustenance of human life” [5].",2022
5118,"When considering ESG, this would mean thinking about how resources should be shared widely and not merely for the benefit of the few.",2022
5119,"Islam

Islamic beliefs also hold respect for the natural environment [6].",2022
5120,"In Islam, Allah created everything in balance, and this includes the Earth and all its living creatures.",2022
5121,"In the Quran, Allah says: “The sun and the moon both run with precision.",2022
5122,The stars and trees bow down in prostration.,2022
5123,"He erected heaven and established the balance, so that you would not transgress the balance” (Ar-Rahman, 55:5-8).",2022
5124,Any sort of harm or abuse of natural resources will affect this balance that Allah was so intentional in creating.,2022
5125,"For ESG, this would mean thinking of balance when using environmental resources, and not merely dismissing the health of the environment.",2022
5126,"Conflict Theory

Social theories are philosophical tools to help understand how society is structured, and conflict theory is one of the major paradigms utilized in sociology.",2022
5127,"An example of a useful tool is conflict theory, which believes that as competition occurs between social groups for scarce resources, inequalities follow [7].",2022
5128,"Conflict theory identifies the inequality in the distribution of the world’s resources as the source of many environmental problems, as well as the role of multinational corporations in resource extraction and the unequal accumulation of wealth as a result.",2022
5129,"With respect to ESG, these inequalities call on businesses and governments to have stronger regulations and guidelines for how to interact with the Earth in a way that is just.",2022
5130,"Land Ethic

When considering environmental ethics, it is impossible to not mention Aldo Leopold’s seminal idea of the land ethic [8].",2022
5131,"A land ethic expands the definition of community to include not just humans, but all parts of the Earth; plants, animals, soils, and waters, which is what Leopold called “the land.” Leopold envisioned a world where the relationship between people and the land are so intertwined that care for people cannot be separated from care for the land.",2022
5132,This land ethic would be a moral code that emerges from these interconnected relationships of care.,2022
5133,"In the world, billions of people share these perspectives on the environment, and we can assume that many of them would like their values for the environment to be respected by corporations.",2022
5134,"We already know that there is a strong desire among consumers for greater environmental consciousness, since that is one of the reasons that ESG exists in the first place.",2022
5135,"Given these two facts, how can ESG be a bridge between businesses, consumers, and the planet?",2022
5136,"ESG Done Wrong and Right

One of the biggest critiques of ESG is the lack of consistency.",2022
5137,"If there are no clearly defined standards that all companies can hold themselves accountable for, then it makes it difficult for transparency to exist between businesses and consumers.",2022
5138,"By comparing two companies who have consistently received positive ESG ratings, we can see the discrepancies within ESG.",2022
5139,"I have chosen companies that were not created with sustainability at the forefront and exist in two of the most profitable industries today (oil and technology), to demonstrate how the shift to ESG can be achieved.",2022
5140,"Chevron

Chevron is the world’s second largest polluter; however, they can still be found receiving high ratings on ESG lists and are seen as an industry leader in ESG [9].",2022
5141,"In their 2021 Climate Change Resilience Report, CEO Michael Wirth states that Chevron’s goal is to “be a leader in efficient and lower carbon production of traditional energy, in high demand today and for years to come, while growing low-carbon businesses that will be a bigger part of the future.” While it is admirable that they want to be a part of a low-carbon future, this statement indicates that they only have a desire to prioritize low-carbon businesses once the market demands it and it becomes inevitable, rather than wanting to take active steps now to be sustainable.",2022
5142,"Chevron also has a long history of causing harm to the environment and marginalized communities, both abroad and in the US.",2022
5143,"From 1964 to 1990, the company dumped 16 billion gallons of toxic waste into the Amazon rainforest, degrading the lands and waters of Indigenous and rural Ecuadorians.",2022
5144,"More recently, in February 2021 Chevron spilled 600 gallons of oil into the San Francisco Bay next to Richmond, CA over the course of 2 hours [10].",2022
5145,"This is just one recent incident of Chevron’s environmental and health effects, as they have consistently been a hazard to the health of Richmond residents.",2022
5146,"The Richmond refinery is one of the largest polluters in the state, and from 2008 to 2018 state records indicate that the refinery released nearly the same amount of greenhouse gas emissions over the ten year period [11].",2022
5147,How can Chevron paint themselves as a champion of ESG when they are doing this kind of harm to the planet and its people?,2022
5148,"Perhaps more importantly, how can this company whose business model is built on the extraction, sale, and eventual burning of fossil fuels (and claim to have their interests in a greener future) possibly have a high ESG rating?",2022
5149,This discrepancy points to a fundamental flaw in contemporary ESG: words speak louder than actions.,2022
5150,"Through Chevron’s marketing and gesturing towards environmental progress, they are able to receive credibility as a sustainable enterprise when they clearly are not.",2022
5151,From the many diverse perspectives above we could see how Chevron might be vulnerable to several harsh critiques.,2022
5152,"For example, burning fossil fuels harms the shared good of the atmosphere and climate which many cultures care deeply about.",2022
5153,Chevron’s acquisition of oil demonstrates little care for how it leaves less resources for future generations or how the burning of fossil fuels leads to climate and health effects that disproportionately affect those who are already facing inequalities.,2022
5154,"This runs afoul of many perspectives on the environment, perhaps most noticeably conflict theory, which cares specifically about inequality.",2022
5155,"Microsoft

Microsoft is one of the largest technology companies in the world, producing computer software, consumer electronics, personal computers, and more.",2022
5156,"In their 2020 Environmental Sustainability report, Microsoft identified four areas - carbon, water, waste, and ecosystems - that they will focus their efforts to minimize the negative environmental impacts of their operations and maximize the positive impacts of their technology [12].",2022
5157,"Because of these intentions, Microsoft has been seen in the top ten of several ESG ratings lists, and for good reason.",2022
5158,"The company has been carbon neutral since 2012, is one of the largest purchasers of renewable energy in the nation, and their Puget Sound campus has been zero waste certified since 2016, thus demonstrating that their commitments are more than just intentions.",2022
5159,"In Microsoft’s 2020 Environmental Sustainability Report, president Brad Smith discusses why the company had made the shift, which came from three central questions:

Are we doing enough?",2022
5160,Can we make a difference?,2022
5161,What should we do?,2022
5162,"In response to the first question, the simple answer was no.",2022
5163,"But what might be more important is the answer to the second question, which is yes.",2022
5164,The first step to action is the recognition that you have the power to enact change.,2022
5165,Microsoft believes that they can drive change for good rather than bad.,2022
5166,"In order to achieve the sustainable world they envision, they are changing their operations and their relationships with organizations and institutions around the world.",2022
5167,"Microsoft has made a series of industry-leading commitments to be a carbon negative, water positive, and zero waste company by 2030.",2022
5168,Perhaps the most impressive among Microsoft’s sustainable goals is removing from the environment all the carbon the company has emitted since its founding by 2050.,2022
5169,"This goal demonstrates not only that Microsoft is admitting accountability for their actions over their history as a company, but also that they are trying to make up for their bad actions.",2022
5170,"If Chevron did this it would be a very heavy lift, but it would also all the more impressive for admitting their mistakes and attempting to make amends.",2022
5171,"While these commitments might seem like mere talk, with full accountability decades in the future, the fact that Microsoft has already made some commitments and fulfilled them does lend confidence to the idea that it might make good on these future goals too.",2022
5172,From the perspective of various cultures examined above we might also see that Microsoft is being a good environmental steward.,2022
5173,"Considering the beliefs from various faith backgrounds, an important part of living out religious values is engaging in a process of discernment, which is similar to the process that Smith went through when reviewing Microsoft’s ESG strategy.",2022
5174,Microsoft has acknowledged the dependence of human life on the wellbeing of the environment and is working to preserve natural resources for humans now and to come.,2022
5175,"Conclusion

ESG is a good first step for businesses to claim their role in creating a more sustainable future, but ESG can and should be so much more.",2022
5176,"Integrating diverse perspectives of environmentalism around the world will help to ensure that the Earth, its resources, and its people are taken care of for years to come.",2022
5177,This broad-based approach to environmentalism will also help to make corporate ESG activities more comprehensible and appreciable to people and cultures around the world.,2022
5178,The Earth belongs to everyone.,2022
5179,Businesses can no longer continue to act as if only wealthy Western perspectives count because their operations and impacts are clearly global and affect people globally.,2022
5180,"Earth’s natural resources are not infinite, and many are diminishing every day.",2022
5181,Developing ESG practices that are informed by science and acknowledge the wellbeing of all people will be key in having businesses become a part of solving Earth’s environmental crisis.,2022

It added, “While Microsoft allows employees to use a ‘self-directed’ investment option to choose other funds, only 6 percent of employee retirement funds are invested outside the Plan.”

5258,"And as Capital Monitor has reported, shareholders are struggling to act on these concerns due to their executives ‘super-voting’ rights.",2022
5259,"The three FANGMEN of ESG-linked pay

Of the seven FANGMAN companies, Capital Monitor finds that three – Alphabet, Microsoft and Apple - currently link some executive compensation to ESG targets.",2022
5260,"The first to do so was Microsoft in 2016, which uses a weighted approach similar to that applied by oil majors such as Shell and TotalEnergies.",2022
5261,"Capital Monitor calculates that Microsoft apportions approximately 2.5% of its executive bonus to ESG targets, down approximately 4% last year.",2022
5262,"According to its latest SEC filings, one-third of Microsoft’s annual cash incentive (which totalled $14.2m) is non-financial, of which 10% is tied to performance on issues relating to ‘customers & stakeholders’, reduced from 16.67% in 2020.",2022

Apple, by contrast, doesn’t weight bonuses against targets.",2022
5267,"Rather, since 2021, the tech giant has applied an ‘ESG modifier’ to its cash incentive programme, which can either increase or decrease the final bonus by up to 10%.",2022
5268,"While this past financial year was the first in which this policy was put in place, the ESG modifier was not applied, as its executives had already maxed all the possible bonus pay they could earn, as it is capped at 200% of the total target.",2022
5269,"Alphabet, which owns Google, rolled out its ESG compensation policy in February this year.",2022
5270,Executives can receive a maximum of $2m as an annual cash bonus based on contributions to Google’s performance against social and environmental goals for 2022.,2022
5271,The company has provided no further details on how executive pay will be measured against these goals.,2022

Though nascent, such policies in the sector follow years of campaigning.",2022
5273,"Capital Monitor’s analysis of data compiled by Ceres, a sustainable non-profit focused on capital markets, finds that close to a third of US shareholder resolutions calling for ESG-linked pay tabled at companies over the past decade are concentrated among energy companies.",2022
5274,"As such, it’s little surprise that so many of them implement such policies.",2022
5275,"Of the 95 relevant shareholder resolutions included in this database, three took place across Alphabet, Amazon and Apple.",2022
5276,"At each company, the same proposal was submitted multiple times by a firm called Zevin Asset Management, a boutique, self-described ‘socially responsible’ investment firm with just $443m assets under management.",2022
5277,"On each submission, Zevin Asset Management called on these tech majors to tie their executive pay to ESG metrics, as a means of forcing them to take greater action on social issues.",2022
5278,"Though the resolutions didn’t pass, they appear to have succeeded in mounting pressure on these firms, as both Apple and Alphabet eventually adopted these policies.",2022
5279,"For example, in January 2020, Zevin Asset Management filed a resolution at Alphabet claiming that the ‘tech diversity crisis threatens worker safety, talent retention, product development, and customer service’.",2022
5280,"It warned that such ‘human capital risks’ were ‘playing out as controversies’ at the company, referencing a situation in November 2018 when more than 20,000 workers walked out of Alphabet offices in protest of its mishandling of sexual misconduct cases.",2022
5281,"The proposal also cited concerns about the company’s inclusion, pointing out that among Alphabet's top 290 managers in 2017, just over a quarter were women and just 17 managers were ‘underrepresented people of colour.’ As with the other resolutions it filed, Zevin Asset Management argued that ‘clearly disclosed, comprehensive links among sustainability, equity, and executive compensation would enhance Alphabet's approach’ on tackling these issues.",2022
5282,"Though the proposal still went to vote, and gathered just 12.2% of shareholder’s support, Alphabet had decided shortly beforehand to adopt an ESG-linked pay bonus structure.",2022
5283,"Also in 2020, Zevin Asset Management shared a similar proposal at Apple, which received just 12.1% support from shareholders.",2022
5284,"Similar to what happened at Alphabet, shortly after the asset manager decided to repeat the same proposal the following year, Apple decided to implement an ESG-linked pay policy.",2022
5285,"On its website, Zevin Asset Management describes holding a series of calls and meetings with Apple in which they discussed the proposal in the months leading up to the company implementing its ESG modifier.",2022
5286,"Amazon, however, refused: while Zevin Asset Management’s initial 2019 proposal that the company link executive compensation to ESG metrics received more than 19% of the shareholder vote — a large proportion considering CEO Jeff Bezos’s oversized share in the company — Amazon took the step of refusing the proposal on the grounds of a technicality and omitting it from the ballot the following year.",2022
5287,A spokesperson for Amazon pointed Capital Monitor in the direction of its 2022 proxy statement.,2022
5288,It states incorporating what it calls discrete incentives into executive remuneration is a major source of “complexity and confusion” and believes corporate policy should be enough to incentivise executives to act in the interests of it.,2022

5295,"Earlier this month, the company raised $130 million to advance its technology, with Microsoft Climate Innovation Fund as one of the investors.",2022
5296,"Nicholas Flanders, Co-Founder, and CEO of Twelve, said:

“By producing our drop-in E-Jet fuel from captured CO 2 , we can rapidly and efficiently close the carbon cycle and allow businesses to sustainably use emissions to power their own business travel.",2022
5297,"Partnering with progress-minded brands like Alaska Airlines and Microsoft adds thrust as we work towards delivering industrial-scale volumes of E-Jet.”

Air transport has come under increasing scrutiny in recent years as a significant contributor to GHG emissions, accounting for an estimated 2% of global GHG emissions.",2022
5298,"SAF is seen by market participants as one of the key tools for the industry to address its climate impact, as it generates significantly lower lifecycle carbon emissions relative to conventional jet fuel.",2022
5299,"SAF is generally produced from sustainable resources, like waste oils and agricultural residues, or even from carbon captured from the air, rather than from fossil fuels.",2022

5304,Software licensing costs matter.,2022
5305,"Evolve Cloud Services, an AWS Partner who specializes in cloud and software licensing optimization, knows this full well.",2022
5306,"Recently, Evolve teamed up with Enterprise Strategy Group (ESG)—an IT analyst, research, validation, and strategy firm—to analyze the results of 300 extensive Optimization and License Assessments conducted for organizations wanting to migrate their Microsoft workloads to AWS.",2022
5307,"ESG published their findings in this whitepaper, Reduce Licensing and Infrastructure Costs while on the Move to the AWS Cloud.",2022
5308,"Some of the key findings in this report include:

Software licensing costs are 3X the cost of all other costs in the cloud combined (e.g., compute, network, and storage).",2022
5309,"On average, Evolve has been able to reduce the number of Windows Server cores requiring a license by 77% and the number of SQL Server cores requiring a license by 45% when modeling workloads from on premises to AWS.",2022
5310,Taking advantage of your existing license investments will greatly reduce your overall cost of entry into AWS.,2022
5311,"Your Microsoft workloads can run more efficiently on AWS, thus reducing your overall licensing needs.",2022
5312,"In this blog post, I spoke with Evolve’s Steve Lohr, CEO and founder, and Jason Volpe, vice president of solutions, who firmly believe that it’s essential to take existing Microsoft volume licenses into account when considering a cloud migration.",2022
5313,"They explain how Microsoft licensing works on AWS and answer key questions often asked by their customers, illustrated with actual customer experiences.",2022
5314,"How does my SQL Server workload convert from on premises to AWS from a license perspective, one-to-one?",2022
5315,"The license that you own will convert one-to-one, meaning Microsoft does not have a core factor for their licensing—similar to what Oracle does.",2022
5316,"That being said, we’ll likely be able to run your on-premises SQL Server workloads on fewer cores on AWS, which would save you money.",2022
5317,"On average, customers have been able to reduce the SQL Server cores that need to be licensed by 45% when moving from on premises to AWS.",2022
5318,"For Windows Server, this percentage is even higher.",2022
5319,"Customers, on average, can reduce their Windows Server licenses by 77%.",2022
5320,The whitepaper dives into these details.,2022
5321,How can I use my existing SQL Server and Windows Server licenses on AWS?,2022
5322,"Similar to on premises, you can use existing SQL Server licenses to bring your own license (BYOL) to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) shared tenancy, licensing per instance with a 4-core minimum.",2022
5323,SQL Server licenses—with or without Software Assurance—can also BYOL to Amazon EC2 Dedicated Hosts.,2022
5324,This allows you to license by host or per instance.,2022
5325,"To license SQL Server by host, license the physical cores of the Dedicated Host using SQL Server Enterprise.",2022
5326,Doing so will cover all SQL Server instances deployed on that host.,2022
5327,"For Windows Server, bring your existing Windows Server licenses to AWS and license the physical cores of the Dedicated Host.",2022
5328,Note that Software Assurance is not required here.,2022
5329,What licensing options do I have with my SQL Server workloads on AWS?,2022
5330,"If you are carrying Software Assurance on your SQL Server licenses, you can upgrade to a newer version of SQL Server that is still in support.",2022
5331,"If your database cannot be upgraded past SQL Server 2012, you have the option to purchase Extended Security Updates (ESU) through Microsoft if you have active Software Assurance.",2022
5332,"That said, ESUs are very expensive, require an annual commitment, and are approximately 75% of the license cost per year.",2022
5333,The whitepaper discusses this more.,2022
5334,"If you don’t own Software Assurance or the license itself, another option is to use SQL Server License Included (LI) through AWS.",2022
5335,SQL Server LI is more cost-effective since it doesn’t require you to pay for the full licensing cost upfront.,2022
5336,"Instead, you pay per-second licensing on a subscription, with the option to turn the license off at any time for no additional cost.",2022
5337,"For AWS LI, ESU is also available for purchase from Microsoft.",2022
5338,"Most importantly, we encourage you to leverage this opportunity to think about the future state of your business and take action to optimize your SQL Server workloads.",2022
5339,"AWS provides a variety of flexible options to migrate and modernize your SQL Server workloads, each with their own unique benefits best suited for your situation.",2022
5340,Are there limitations when migrating my SQL Server and Windows Server licenses to AWS?,2022
5341,The software licensing rules for SQL Server on AWS are similar to the rules for on premises.,2022
5342,"Microsoft requires active Software Assurance to enable License Mobility, which allows SQL Server workloads to move between physical hosts on premises, as well as run in shared tenancy on AWS.",2022
5343,"However, Microsoft is becoming more restrictive when it comes to Windows Server licensing.",2022
5344,"On October 1, 2019, Microsoft implemented a rule change that states:

Customers cannot bring any Windows Server license purchased after October 1, 2019, to AWS or other non-Microsoft public clouds; and

Customers cannot bring any Windows Server license for versions released after October 1, 2019, to AWS or other non-Microsoft public clouds.",2022
5345,"Despite this rule change, 96% of our customers own legacy Windows Server licenses that still give them BYOL use rights on Amazon EC2 Dedicated Hosts, leading to significant cost savings.",2022
5346,Can Evolve help customers who want to migrate to AWS with their Microsoft Enterprise Agreement renewals?,2022
5347,"Yes, Evolve has helped hundreds of customers realize significant cost savings when moving to AWS upon renegotiation with Microsoft.",2022
5348,"One such example is a prominent Fortune 500 financial services company, who moved 10,000 cores of Windows Server to AWS using the BYOL option on Amazon EC2 Dedicated Hosts.",2022
5349,"At the time, the company was 6 months away from its first Enterprise Agreement (EA) renewal since Microsoft had implemented the October 1, 2019 use right changes.",2022
5350,Microsoft informed the customer that they didn’t have BYOL rights to AWS and that they needed to convert their Windows Server perpetual licenses to a subscription model at renewal within the next 6 months.,2022
5351,"Had this customer moved forward with subscription licensing, they would have spent over 2 years defining their cloud strategy, gaining internal support, and getting the necessary budget—only to unknowingly forfeit all BYOL rights on over 10,000 Windows Server core licenses.",2022
5352,AWS helped this customer realize that they did have BYOL rights on Windows Server and confirmed that they would indeed lose BYOL rights if they moved to a subscription model at renewal.,2022
5353,"As a result, the customer did not take the advice from Microsoft or its reseller to convert to a Windows Server subscription at renewal.",2022
5354,"Today, the customer is set up for success in its cloud journey with full BYOL rights to each Windows Server license they own, allowing them to move forward with their cloud strategy unimpeded by vendor licensing restrictions.",2022
5355,Has Evolve worked with any customers trying to decide which cloud to migrate their Microsoft workloads to?,2022
5356,"Yes, several.",2022
5357,We have a Fortune 500 life sciences company that was evaluating cloud migrations to both Azure and AWS.,2022
5358,The company was extremely concerned about the licensing impact for both Windows Server and SQL Server.,2022
5359,"In fact, the company initially stated that they were only performing an AWS sizing exercise because they were required to assess more than one cloud vendor.",2022
5360,They didn’t foresee AWS being more cost-effective than Azure.,2022
5361,"Through a license optimization model, this company realized the cost savings it would gain through AWS.",2022
5362,The model helped the company understand the additional Windows Server licenses they would need to purchase if they migrated to Azure using Azure Hybrid Benefit (AHB).,2022
5363,"The customer owned over 25,000 Windows Server core licenses on premises.",2022
5364,"With AHB’s Windows Server 8-core minimum license requirement per VM, the model showed that they would have been short over 30,000 Windows Server core licenses had they continued with Azure.",2022
5365,"Another way to look at it is that the company would have run out of Windows Server licenses after migrating only 30% of their Windows Servers to Azure, thus requiring them to buy thousands of additional core licenses they hadn’t budgeted for, as well as significantly increasing their annual Software Assurance spend.",2022
5366,Our customer expressed concern about this and the lack of transparency surrounding it.,2022
5367,"In the end, the customer rapidly moved to AWS using the specific deployment model recommended during the Optimization and Licensing Assessment process.",2022
5368,"My IT infrastructure consists of workloads running on Microsoft SQL Server 2012, which reached end of support (EOS) on July 12, 2022.",2022
5369,"If I consider migrating to the cloud, do I have to invest in new SQL Server licenses when I move to AWS?",2022
5370,"No, you do not need to invest in new licenses when moving to AWS.",2022
5371,"With AWS’ BYOL option, you’re able to bring your existing SQL Server licenses to Amazon EC2 shared tenancy if you have active Software Assurance.",2022
5372,"Even without Software Assurance, you are still able to bring your existing licenses to Amazon EC2 Dedicated Hosts.",2022
5373,"Note that licenses purchased after October 1, 2019, are subject to Microsoft’s changed license terms.",2022
5374,Can I run SQL Server 2012 on AWS?,2022
5375,"Yes, you can run SQL Server 2012 on AWS.",2022
5376,"However, since Microsoft no longer provides patches or security updates for the 2012 version, it may cause compliance issues and security risks for your applications.",2022
5377,"By using the AWS Systems Manager Automation runbook, you can easily upgrade from SQL Server 2012 to newer supported versions on Amazon EC2.",2022
5378,I don’t have Software Assurance for my older SQL Server licenses.,2022
5379,Can I still migrate to AWS?,2022
5380,"Yes, but to have BYOL rights without Software Assurance, you need to have purchased the SQL Server licenses on an agreement that was active prior to October 1, 2019.",2022
5381,"Additionally, SQL Server without Software Assurance is limited to SQL Server 2017 or earlier.",2022
5382,"If you purchased the SQL Server licenses after October 1, 2019, you still need an active Software Assurance.",2022
5383,"Once you migrate to Amazon EC2 Dedicated Hosts, you will have the option to eventually upgrade to a newer version of Microsoft SQL Server by procuring the license through Microsoft or through AWS (with the license included option).",2022
5384,"That said, we find that many customers ultimately use technologies like Babelfish for Aurora PostgreSQL to modernize from Microsoft SQL Server to Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL with little to no code change.",2022
5385,"Generally speaking, Software Assurance makes up roughly 20% of the overall cost—as discussed in the whitepaper—while PostgreSQL in Amazon Aurora, for instance, has no licensing costs.",2022

6925,"Our Methodology

Generally, sustainable equity funds approach portfolio construction much the same as traditional fund managers, by searching for quality investments with long-term capital appreciation prospects and unique risk and return characteristics.",2023
6926,"Like all funds, these sustainable equity managers seek to outperform their benchmarks, minimize risk, and protect and expand their portfolios.",2023
6927,"On top of that, sustainable funds also use ESG data and metrics to pursue their objectives.",2023
6928,These approaches can vary.,2023
6929,One approach might be excluding investments based on moral values.,2023
6930,"Others include limiting ESG risk, seeking ESG opportunities, or targeting sustainability themes.",2023
6931,"(For a full list, please check out the Morningstar Sustainable-Investing Framework.)",2023
6932,"Despite headwinds from the anti-ESG movement, sustainability experts say that ESG investing has become more mainstream as an additional layer of insight to inform financial decisions.",2023
6933,"As you might expect, there is also evidence of differing strategies when you analyze the distribution of weights among the holdings of both types of funds.",2023
6934,Here’s what we did to compare the funds.,2023
6935,"For large-cap ESG funds, we aggregated the holdings of the oldest share classes of all U.S. sustainable large-cap funds.",2023
6936,We took the 200 securities that were most commonly owned and then calculated what the average weight of each stock might be in a theoretical portfolio that owned all 200 stocks.,2023
6937,Each stock’s weight in the model was determined by taking its average weight and dividing it by the sum of the top 200 stocks’ average weights in the sustainable universe.,2023
6938,"As an example, if Microsoft had an average weight across the universe of 15%, and the sum of the 200 highest average weighted securities in the universe was 350%, Microsoft would have a model weight of 4.3%.",2023
6939,"This process for model creation was then repeated for the “traditional universe.” The traditional universe was defined for large-cap funds as the oldest share classes of U.S. large-cap funds, excluding sustainable funds.",2023
6940,"Our objective is to gain insights into the unique or underweight securities held by sustainable funds in the large-, mid-, and small-cap universes.",2023
6941,Securities in the sustainable model that hold a greater position than the traditional model are considered “overweight” in this study.,2023

6950,"Except for Amazon.com AMZN and Alphabet GOOGL, these market-cap giants (which also include Apple AAPL, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla) are overweight in the sustainable model as compared with the traditional model.",2023
6951,Why so much overlap?,2023
6952,"The explanation lies in tracking error, a measure of volatility between a fund and its index.",2023
6953,"“Most sustainable large-blend funds still aim to be suitable as core portfolio holdings, meaning that their performance should be similar to large-blend benchmarks,” says Alyssa Stankiewicz, Morningstar’s associate director for sustainability research.",2023
6954,"“To fully exclude a name such as Microsoft or Apple, which are large portions of the market, an ESG-focused fund would be courting significant performance differences compared with traditional benchmarks.”

Thus, it’s common for active ESG-focused portfolio managers to hold slightly more or slightly less in a given name.",2023

7203,"To put that in perspective, that means a single server can consume as much as a typical cloud rack.",2023
7204,"All of that heat needs to go somewhere, and depending on the datacenter cooling technology, hotter systems can translate into greater water consumption.",2023
7205,Within these facilities water is used in a variety of datacenter cooling applications.,2023
7206,Deionized water and other fluids can be used in direct liquid cooled (DLC) systems.,2023
7207,"Rather than blow air over a heatsink to cool the processors and GPUs, this tech removes heat by passing coolant through cold plates attached to hotspots throughout the system.",2023
7208,"As we've previously reported, this approach is considerably more efficient than traditional air cooling.",2023
7209,Google actually uses DLC to cool its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) used in AI training and inference workloads.,2023
7210,"However, many modern GPUs systems are still air cooled.",2023
7211,"No matter which technology is used, complex air-handling and thermal-management systems are required to get the heat out of the datacenter.",2023
7212,"One of the most efficient ways to do this is using evaporative coolers, like cooling towers.",2023
7213,This technique uses water to pull the heat out of the air exiting the datacenter.,2023
7214,"As the hot air causes the water to evaporate, it is chilled back to a usable temperature.",2023
7215,Evaporative cooling tech is quite popular among datacenter operators as it tends to use less power than alternative tech and in many climates they only need to be run during the hottest months of the year.,2023
7216,This approach to cooling can be problematic in certain regions where access to water or treatment facilities is limited.,2023
7217,"In datacenter hubs such as Phoenix, Arizona, many datacenters have transitioned to alternative cooling technologies, which don't consume water directly but do tend to use more power and generate more noise pollution.",2023
7218,How much water are we talking about?,2023
7219,Microsoft says it used about 1.6 million cubic meters more water in 2022 than in 2021.,2023
7220,To put that in perspective that's enough water to fill 640 Olympic sized swimming pools; a volume equivalent to more than three billion grapefruit.,2023
7221,And that's just new water consumption.,2023
7222,"Microsoft's total water consumption for 2022 is the equivalent of 2,560 Olympic pools.",2023
7223,"In 2021, Researchers at the University of Oxford estimated that US datacenters collectively consumed about 1.7 billion litres of water per day.",2023
7224,"However, they note that measuring datacenter water consumption is often challenged by a lack of transparency.",2023

7226,"""ChatGPT needs to 'drink' a 500ml bottle of water for a simple conversation of roughly 20-50 questions and answers, depending on when and where ChatGPT is deployed,"" the researchers estimated in an April paper.",2023
7227,"However, as we've previously discussed, actual water consumption associated with running LLMs, like ChatGPT, depends on a variety of factors including the thermal management technologies used by the facility, where those models are being trained and run, and when those jobs are run.",2023
7228,"For example, datacenters located in a colder climates are likely to consume less water and can take advantage of lower ambient temperatures, especially compared to those in hot, arid desert climes.",2023
7229,"According to the AP report, the Iowa datacenter where Microsoft and OpenAI trained GPT-4 only consumes water when the temperature is above 29.3 degrees Celsius.",2023
7230,What is Microsoft doing to mitigate its water consumption?,2023
7231,"In its ESG report, Microsoft claims it's using water consumption metrics to guide water reclamation efforts as it seeks to be net ""water positive"" by 2030.",2023
7232,"Projects to reach that elusive ""water positive"" state typically involve funding projects to protect watersheds, restore wetlands, and improve infrastructure in water stressed regions.",2023
7233,"For example, in Chennai, India, where Microsoft operates a datacenter, the company worked with The Natural Conservancy to restore the wetlands around Lake Sembakkam.",2023
7234,"To date, Microsoft says it's signed 35 million cubic meters of water reclamation projects.",2023
7235,The Windows maker also says it's working on thermal management technologies to reduce the water consumption of its facilities.,2023
7236,"This includes a geoexchange system at its Thermal Energy Center in Redmond, which rejects heat to the ground rather than relying on cooling towers.",2023
7237,"The technology is expected to reduce that facility's water consumption by about 30,280 cubic meters — or about 12 Olympic swimming pools.",2023
7238,Microsoft has also moved away from evaporative coolers at some of its most water challenged datacenters.,2023
7239,"This spring, they agreed to transition its final two datacenters, located outside Phoenix to ""zero water"" cooling infrastructure.",2023
7240,How do the other cloud providers stack up?,2023
7241,Microsoft isn't the only cloud provider grappling with water consumption.,2023
7242,"As Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud have steadily expanded their cloud empires, they've announced several efforts to curb their datacenter drinking problem.",2023
7243,"Last fall AWS, committed to becoming ""water positive"" by 2023, which is to say, they claim they'll return more water to communities than is consumed by their operations.",2023

Ge Yan, a professor at Indiana University’s Kelley School of Business, began using Copilot for Microsoft 365 last November to take advantage of its assistance with various administrative tasks.",2024
8118,"Yan likes to know his audience to help him tailor his teaching approach, so before every new class begins, he securely downloads the roster into Excel and breaks out demographics such as ages, genders, grade levels, majors, where students are from and more.",2024
8119,"Even though he has a computer science MBA and more than two decades of experience creating spreadsheets and pivot tables, Yan found that Copilot in Excel could handle the job more efficiently.",2024
8120,"Being able to simply ask questions in the tool, rather than having to manipulate columns and cells between each query, helped his thought process flow more smoothly and naturally, Yan says, giving him a better picture of each incoming class.",2024
8121,"Ge Yan, a professor at Indiana University.",2024
8122,Yan realized the same benefits could extend to students.,2024
8123,"Educators have already begun piloting Copilot for Microsoft 365, and starting in April, higher education students 18 and older will be eligible, too.",2024

8138,"If she was late, got distracted by an urgent email, or had to step away to walk her kids to the bus stop, she’d prompt Copilot for a summary of the timeframe she’d missed and then could jump into the discussion without having to interrupt the flow by asking fellow participants to catch her up.",2024
8139,"“I have too many tabs open in my brain, so this is helpful in keeping track of all those things,” she says.",2024
8140,"“And the nice part about Copilot (for Microsoft 365) is that it’s all staying within your unit’s data cloud.”

8146,"(Photo provided by Leftwich)

For the self-described design-challenged professor — “I’m a former elementary school teacher, and everything I do tends to turn into rainbows and sparkles” — who has to create hundreds of presentations every year, Copilot in PowerPoint has made a big difference.",2024
8147,"Leftwich can pull an outline into the app, type in a few guiding prompts, and within moments Copilot crafts a polished, professional, cohesive design that she says she never could have come up with on her own, even if she’d spent hours working on it.",2024
8148,"Clerical assistance aside, it’s the chat function with AI tools that causes the most consternation in education circles.",2024

Educators and students 18 and older can use Copilot with their school accounts, giving them commercial data protection and a secure chat service.",2024
8164,And Microsoft is expanding that option with a private preview program for younger learners in coming months.,2024

8266,"In the latest development, the solar manufacturer Qcells has announced that its new factory — in Georgia — will churn out a whopping 12 gigawatts’ worth of solar modules on behalf of Microsoft, and that’s not the only decarbonization trick up the Peach State’s sleeve.",2024
8267,"12 GW Solar Power Deal Burns Up The Intertubes

The Internet was practically humming with news about the solar power hookup between QCells and Microsoft.",2024
8268,"It’s a giant step up from an agreement announced between the companies last year, which *only* covered 2.5 gigawatts.",2024
8269,"The new arrangement turbo-boosts the total up to 12 gigawatts, including engineering, procurement, and construction services.",2024
8270,"The two companies expect to bring 1.5 gigawatts’ worth of solar panels per year to upcoming solar power projects, for which Microsoft has already nailed down contracts through 2032.",2024
8271,"“The solar modules will be supplied by Qcells’ highly anticipated fully-integrated solar supply chain factory in Cartersville, Georgia, which is a part of Qcells’ $2.5 billion investment announced last year,” QCells explained.",2024

8274,"The company is a branch of the South Korean solar power leader Hanwha, and CleanTechnica has been following its many ventures in the US and elsewhere.",2024
8275,The activity has ratched up since passage of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (see more Qcells coverage here).,2024
8276,The new Cartersville factory is just one of two new Qcells ventures in Georgia.,2024
8277,"The other one involves expanding the company’s existing solar manufacturing facility in Dalton, Georgia.",2024
8278,"“The Qcells Dalton factory is the largest manufacturing plant of its kind in the Western Hemisphere and the first solar panel plant expansion since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA),” Qcells noted in a press release on October 18, 2023.",2024
8279,"“This addition marks the first phase of Qcells’ historic $2.5 billion investment announced in January 2023,” they added, describing it as “the largest investment in the history of American solar,” establishing Qcells as “the only company in the U.S. to establish a fully-integrated, silicon-based solar supply chain from raw material to finished panel.”

Well, that certainly puts Georgia on the solar power map, even without the addition of the new Cartersville plant.",2024
8280,"In fact, Qcells and its parent company Hanwha have been showering Georgia with new jobs for quite some time now, ever since the company first entered the state in 2018.",2024

Georgia Governor Brian Kemp had an opportunity to enthuse over Qcells’s Georgia ventures in a press release dated March 23, 2023, which celebrated Qcells’s sister company, Hanwha Advanced Materials Georgia, Inc., for putting up $147 million to build a new facility in Georgia.",2024
8282,"The new factory will supply Qcells with protective encapsulant films for its solar cells, making Georgia the only state in the US where solar encapsulants are made.",2024

8285,"“As a Top Ten state for solar energy production, solar photovoltaic is the fastest-growing source of energy in Georgia, which the Solar Energy Industries Association ranked seventh by cumulative solar capacity in 2022,” Kemp’s office also noted.",2024
8286,"“Georgia’s energy solutions providers are helping to accelerate the development of renewable energy products by lowering risks, reducing costs, providing access to innovative industry research, and investing in a superior infrastructure network.”

Oh The Irony, It Burns

If you caught that thing about “competitive project,” that refers to land and other taxpayer resources that Georgia has invested to attract Qcells to itself, along with other fossil fuel-killing ventures.",2024
8287,“During Gov.,2024

8294,"ESG is short for the environmental, social, and governance goals that have become commonplace in the financial industry and elsewhere in the corporate world.",2024
8295,DeSantis and his allies have a somewhat different perspective.,2024
8296,"“The proliferation of ESG throughout America is a direct threat to the American economy, individual economic freedom, and our way of life, putting investment decisions in the hands of the woke mob to bypass the ballot box and inject political ideology into investment decisions, corporate governance, and the everyday economy,” begins an open letter signed by Kemp, DeSantis, and 17 other Republican governors.",2024
8297,"“We as freedom loving states can work together and leverage our state pension funds to force change in how major asset managers invest the money of hardworking Americans, ensuring corporations are focused on maximizing shareholder value, rather than the proliferation of woke ideology,” the letter adds.",2024
8298,"The letter is dated March 16, 2023.",2024
8299,"Go ahead and read it to get the full effect, then take a look at what Kemp said just one week later, on March 23 (here’s that link again):

“Georgia is leading the nation in attracting next generation jobs.",2024
8300,"Since we first welcomed Qcells to our state in 2018, we’ve announced more than 4,000 related jobs for hardworking Georgians.",2024
8301,"We’re proud that Hanwha Advanced Materials is adding to that growing number as it becomes a valued member of the Bartow County community.”

Georgia is not the only Republican-led state to pull the rug out from under the anti-ESG campaign, but it sure sticks out like a sore thumb.",2024
8302,"In another indication that the anti-ESG campaign is running out of steam, last fall the state’s leading utility, Georgia Power, announced that it is expanding its plans for solar power and energy storage projects, as part of a strategy to saftisfy the “record scale and velocity” of demand for electricity by new businesses coming into the state.",2024
8303,"One might wonder what the fuss over ESG is all about, considering that Georgia has been reaping the economic benefits of clean tech and ESG investing.",2024
8304,"If you have any thoughts about that, drop us a note in the comment thread.",2024

8440,"Claudia Hauser explains how technology by Microsoft and its partner ecosystem is enabling a more environmentally and socially responsible financial services industry

ESG stands for “the environmental, social and governance criteria that are used by investors and other stakeholders to assess a company’s impact, value and potential for investment, risk and opportunities,” says Claudia Hauser, worldwide capital markets solutions director for Microsoft Financial Services.",2024
8441,"As these metrics gain prominence in investment analysis, risk management and decision-making processes and regulations, financial services organisations need to consider how best to compile them and how to embed them into operational processes.",2024
8442,"“While there is no globally agreed definition of ESG nor global standard for its reporting, there are several frameworks and guidelines for companies to report their ESG performance,” says Hauser.",2024
8443,"“Some of the most widely used frameworks include the Global Reporting Initiative, the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board’s requirements and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures.",2024
8444,"These provide guidance on how companies can measure and report their progress over time in a consistent and transparent manner.”

As the largest company in the world, with a market capital of more than $3 trillion, Microsoft has a strong commitment to sustainability and shares its progress with stakeholders and customers.",2024
8445,"It uses a variety of reporting metrics to measure its performance including carbon emissions, energy usage, water consumption, waste generation and employee diversity.",2024
8446,"A few years into its own journey, Microsoft is committed to helping its customers and partners to move towards a more sustainable future.",2024
8447,"“Microsoft Cloud for Financial Services and Sustainability Data solutions on Microsoft Fabric help financial services firms to unify all their data, including ESG data, into a single lake-centric and open data estate for all their first and third-party data sources for a single source of truth,” says Hauser.",2024
8448,“Users can then use AI-powered tools to manage and get intelligence from that data.,2024

8642,"Mario Schlener, EY Canada risk consulting leader, said a key reason for the system’s development is that “our clients recognize the need for reliable systems to effectively manage and report environmental, social, and governance (ESG) data, but finding such systems proves challenging.”

The initiative, according to a release, “combines data analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), cloud technology and top-tier risk models to further Canada’s transition to a low-carbon economy.”

The release went on to say that “disclosure requirements established by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI), along with regulations imposed by other global authorities, are compelling financial institutions to prioritize climate reporting and transparency.",2024
8643,"“Through collaboration with the Canadian financial services sector, this solution not only evaluates the impact of transition risk across various sectors of the economy, but also provides valuable insights to assist financial institutions in strategizing for client engagement initiatives and refining their decarbonization strategies based on scenario results.”

Katerina Kindyni, financial institutions sustainability leader with EY Canada, said, “operational readiness, resource constraints, and the evolving regulatory landscape pose significant challenges to the seamless execution of climate scenario analysis and stress testing programs.”

The new initiative, she said, is a “centralized tool that enables FIs (financial institutions) to efficiently identify, measure and monitor risks associated with the transition to a net-zero economy, while seamlessly integrating market intelligence into an organization’s infrastructure.”

9484,"The regulations, which also require Nasdaq-listed companies to have diverse boards or explain why they don’t, survived a lawsuit from conservative groups last year, though the organizations are asking an appeals court to take another look.",2024
9485,Nasdaq Inc. has said it created the rules in response to broad investor demand for board diversity disclosures and gave companies flexibility on how to comply.,2024
9486,"Different styles of board diversity disclosures have resulted, making side-by-side comparisons between various companies difficult.",2024
9487,"Each reporting method has tradeoffs for shareholders making voting and investment decisions based on board diversity, said Amy Augustine, director of environmental, social, and governance investing at Boston Trust Walden Co.",2024
9488,"Alphabet and Microsoft provide more detailed information, while the numerical data from Tesla and Amazon is easier to compare to other companies, she said.",2024
9489,"But the reporting overall is helpful for investors in companies that had no requirements for disclosing board diversity before Nasdaq’s rules, Augustine said.",2024
9490,"“It’s so far from where we were when there was no listing standard that it really does feel like progress,” said Augustine, whose investment firm advocated for Nasdaq’s regulations.",2024

Nasdaq offered multiple examples of acceptable matrices companies can use to report their board diversity statistics on websites or in proxy statements that shareholders read before voting in annual meetings.",2024
9494,All of the examples featured numbers; none deployed dots and check marks.,2024
9495,"But the stock exchange permitted companies to “create their own template if the format is substantially similar to the standardized template,” according to its board diversity matrix instructions.",2024
9496,"It was up to companies to decide whether they provide aggregate board diversity data or director-by-director demographics, Nasdaq said.",2024

Of the company’s 12 board members, eight received a board diversity check mark.",2024

9502,"Of the company’s 11 board members, three were women and five identified as a race other than White, according to the dots.",2024
9503,"But Tesla and Amazon took a different path in their 2023 proxy statements, aligning more closely with Nasdaq’s board diversity reporting templates.",2024
9504,"The companies disclosed totals for the men and women on their boards, as well as the race with which they identified.",2024
9505,"Overall, Telsa reported having two women and two directors who weren’t White on its eight-member board, while Amazon said it had five women and two non-White directors on its 11-member board.",2024
9506,But the disclosures didn’t make clear which directors identified as such.,2024
9507,"A company can use dots, check marks or other symbols to disclose board diversity information in tables to comply with Nasdaq’s rules, said Kenneth Silverman, an Olshan Frome Wolosky LLP partner, who advises companies on their proxy statements.",2024
9508,"But the company should have “good reasons” for doing so, like providing investors with more information than they would get under Nasdaq’s suggested templates, he said.",2024
9509,"“Different companies have different perspectives on every element of their business,” Silverman said.",2024
9510,"“There will be language differences.”

Computer Challenges

The board diversity disclosures come as the Securities and Exchange Commission has moved to make data in proxy statements easier for computers to read.",2024
9511,The SEC in 2022—in action unrelated to Nasdaq’s regulations—required companies’ proxy statements to have machine-readable pay-versus-performance data about the ties between their financial showing and executive compensation.,2024
9512,"Companies must use eXtensible Business Reporting Language, also known as XBRL, to report this information as interactive data.",2024
9513,"XBRL data also is found in companies’ annual 10-K reports, quarterly 10-Q filings and other documents filed with the SEC.",2024
9514,"Neither Nasdaq nor the SEC requires companies to report their board diversity information using XBRL, complicating efforts for computers to read the data, especially if it’s conveyed in images instead of numbers, said Campbell Pryde, CEO of XBRL US, which advocates for machine-readable business information.",2024
9515,"Companies still could use symbols to disclose board diversity with XBRL, which could read the underlying data and make it available for analysis, Pryde said.",2024
9516,"“A lot of this data should be put in a standardized format,” he said of corporate disclosures.",2024
9517,"“I think forcing people to write crazy algorithms to pull all this data in is not a good use of anyone’s time.”

SEC Disclosures

The SEC would have the opportunity to refine Nasdaq’s requirements under a board diversity disclosure proposal it’s aiming to release for all public companies in April.",2024

10083,"With that, let's kick things off.",2023
10084,Thank you both for being here.,2023
10085,Excited to get into this.,2023
10086,"To start, you know, the areas of responsible AI and environmental sustainability, we get a lot of questions from our investors.",2023
10087,"It's very top of mind, you know, how would each of you summarize the core commitments in your areas?",2023
10088,Melanie Nakagawa: I'll get started.,2023
10089,So thanks so much.,2023
10090,"So in 2020, Microsoft had made commitments to be carbon negative, water positive and zero waste all by 2030, while also protecting ecosystems.",2023
10091,We're three years into that journey and we remain steadfast in that commitment.,2023
10092,"2022 was a reminder to all of us that to mitigate the most severe impacts of climate change, our impact needs to extend beyond the four walls, and we must continue to accelerate investments that will enable progress for decades to come.",2023

10095,Brett Iversen: Nice.,2023
10096,Natasha?,2023
10097,"Natasha Crampton: Yeah, this is a great question, Brett.",2023
10098,"And when it comes to responsible AI at Microsoft, it is both a practice and a culture.",2023
10099,"So in practice, we've been working to advance responsible AI for nearly seven years now.",2023
10100,"We've built an internal governance structure for developing and deploying AI, and it's really grounded in these six core principles that we have.",2023
10101,"So, fairness, privacy and security, reliability and safety, inclusiveness, accountability, and transparency.",2023
10102,We put these principles into practice across the company and at all levels of the company.,2023
10103,And this approach is really helping us build a culture of responsible AI as well.,2023
10104,"As a company-wide effort, it engages teams working in policy and research and engineering.",2023
10105,"And as we've done for sustainability and accessibility and security, we really want to evolve from responsible AI being something that people must comply with to something that they actually really strive for and take pride in.",2023
10106,Brett Iversen: Love it.,2023
10107,Thank you both.,2023
10108,"You know, for each of you, you could talk about, and you've kind of alluded to this even in the opening, but why this is so important to Microsoft's success.",2023
10109,"You know, how do they mitigate risk?",2023
10110,What do they mean to our employees and customers?,2023
10111,How do they create new opportunities?,2023
10112,Whatever you want to hit within that basket of questions I asked you.,2023
10113,"Melanie, maybe you can start us again on this.",2023
10114,"Melanie Nakagawa: Well, first on this, it's a, you know, this basket of issues.",2023
10115,We really see it in three ways.,2023
10116,"It's getting our house in order, it's what we're doing with customers, and then globally, how do we have an impact?",2023
10117,"So earlier this month, we released our annual report in May of this year.",2023
10118,That is our annual sustainability report.,2023
10119,"And it really shows that progress into this three-year journey that I talked about on our way, the 2030 commitments to be carbon negative, water positive, zero waste, and to protect our ecosystems.",2023
10120,"We reported on carbon, and I'll get into some details here.",2023
10121,"On carbon, while our business grew 18%, emissions actually declined by 0.5%.",2023
10122,"On water, we were able to contract for over 15 million cubic meters of water replenishment projects.",2023
10123,And that's really going to be over the volumetric lifetime of those projects.,2023
10124,"On waste, we have that zero-waste target.",2023
10125,"We actually diverted around 12,000 metric tons of solid waste from landfills and incineration across our direct operational footprint.",2023
10126,"And then on ecosystems, we actually have protected over 12,000 acres of land.",2023
10127,So meeting our company's carbon negative commitment is intricately interdependent on transitioning the world to clean energy infrastructure at the end of the day.,2023
10128,"Our paths will be similar, and progress will appear slow until the foundations are really set and ready to take place.",2023
10129,"So like training for a marathon as a runner, I think as some of us are, it'll take focus, planning, and perseverance to reach the finish line.",2023
10130,"Our Sustainability Connected Community at Microsoft, they're over 9,000 strong here at Microsoft.",2023
10131,"These members and these employees provide such a vital component to how we're collaboratively driving progress on environmental change, both within the company and externally.",2023
10132,"On that second basket, the customer sustainability journey, as a tech company, we have a role to play with the thousands of corporate customers who put their trust in Microsoft technology.",2023
10133,"Many of our customers have already made a climate pledge, and Microsoft is working to help move them from pledges to progress, much like we are.",2023
10134,"Companies can only manage what they can measure, and Microsoft is committed to helping our customers measure their environmental impact in a timely and accurate manner.",2023
10135,"So in June of last year, 2022, we launched the Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability.",2023
10136,This is a comprehensive environmental sustainability management platform that includes the Microsoft Sustainability Manager.,2023
10137,"Microsoft Azure customers also benefited from significant upgrades over the past year to the Emissions Impact Dashboard, which helps customers understand that emissions impact from the results of their use of the Microsoft Cloud.",2023
10138,And then we also released a preview version of something we call the Microsoft Planetary Computer.,2023
10139,"This enables customers to measure, monitor, and manage ecosystems that may be affected by their operations and to make important decisions related to climate risk.",2023
10140,"Brett Iversen: Yeah, a lot happening.",2023
10141,I have three girls at home.,2023
10142,And they perk up the most when they hear what we're doing on sustainability because it's so talked about amongst their peer group as well.,2023
10143,So what would you add?,2023
10144,"Natasha Crampton: So from a responsible AI point of view, we've always operated at Microsoft with the core belief that when we are designing and developing AI responsibly, we are not just leading, developing responsible products, we're developing fundamentally better products.",2023
10145,And we've known for a while that trust is really essential to the adoption of new products.,2023
10146,And that's particularly true when you're talking about frontier tech like AI.,2023
10147,"So that's why we've been working so hard to operationalize our efforts across the company and build this culture of responsible AI, as I was mentioning.",2023
10148,"Look, our employees are being trained on responsible AI practice.",2023
10149,"They're learning how to integrate our practices into their work, and we've been building tools and providing resources to help them on their journey.",2023
10150,"Look, as our customers are exploring the immense potential of AI, they're turning to Microsoft, not just for our AI products, but for insights into how to deploy it and use it responsibly.",2023
10151,So we really want to share as much as we can.,2023
10152,We are committed to making sure that our customers do have that knowledge necessary to use AI responsibly.,2023
10153,And that's in part why we've published our own material.,2023
10154,"So we have a playbook called the Responsible AI Standard, and we published that externally to make sure it's available as a resource.",2023
10155,"We've also shared a template for an impact assessment, which is one of the early practices that we adopt for our responsible AI work.",2023
10156,And we've shared some of our transparency notes as well.,2023
10157,Brett Iversen: You both are busy.,2023
10158,I'm sure.,2023
10159,"You know, the trust piece that you mentioned.",2023
10160,"I have a lot of friends on the sales side, and you know going kind of to the cloud portion of our business and you know, all the products and solutions we sell there, it's the biggest thing.",2023
10161,"Like you would think it's price and things like this when we're competing against some of the other great companies out there, but that trust piece is the biggest portion of the decision that they're hearing consistently.",2023
10162,"So, I'm glad you touched on it.",2023
10163,Maybe another one for you.,2023
10164,"You've been involved in, you know, the responsible AI work through, you know, key points of the development that we've been on.",2023
10165,"Can you help us understand how it's evolved over time and moved from principles to really, to your point, kind of core in the operations on how we do it?",2023
10166,Natasha Crampton: Sure.,2023
10167,"So I think it's fair to say that a decade ago, this field of responsible AI that we've been pioneering at Microsoft, it just barely existed.",2023
10168,"So for nearly seven years now, we've worked to advance responsible AI at the company, and we think of this as sort of building artificial intelligence products and services grounded in strong ethical principles.",2023
10169,"So let me give you two examples, concretely, of how we've progressed this practice over the last seven years.",2023
10170,"So at the very beginning, we had those six principles that I mentioned earlier, and those principles continue to serve as the North Star, but principles alone are not enough.",2023
10171,"So one of the things that we've done is we've taken those principles and really double clicked down on them to provide concrete, actionable guidance for our engineering teams.",2023
10172,So we've basically answered the question of how do you build an AI system fairly?,2023
10173,What does it mean to be accountable?,2023
10174,What does it mean to be transparent?,2023
10175,"So we now have this playbook that our engineering teams use, and as I mentioned, we make it available publicly to really spell out the concrete actionable steps that need to be taken to live up to our commitments here.",2023
10176,"Second, we've been working on tooling.",2023
10177,"You know, one way of making sure there's a consistent practice of responsible AI at Microsoft is to build tools to keep engineers in their day-to-day workflows.",2023
10178,"So whether it's tooling for fairness or interpretability, or making sure that we're really understanding if we are seeing errors, why are they clustering in a particular way?",2023
10179,We've built tooling for teams to be able to understand that better.,2023
10180,"And we don't just build that for our teams internally, we actually bake it into Azure ML, our development platform, so that all of our customers can take advantage of it too.",2023
10181,"So look, today we have almost 350 employees focused on responsible AI as part of their role.",2023
10182,"And we've got people integrated in our product teams, and they come from a huge range of disciplines.",2023
10183,"You know, next year we intend to grow this number of people working in this space even more.",2023
10184,"Look, I have found over time that organizational structures do matter to our ability to meet the ambitious goals that we've set for ourselves here.",2023
10185,"And so one of the things that we have done over time, as well as building out the practice itself, is to make changes to our structure, to make sure that our needs are being met.",2023
10186,So last year we made two key changes to our responsible AI ecosystem.,2023
10187,"First, we made critical new investments in the team responsible for the Azure Open AI service.",2023
10188,This is a service that has all of the cutting-edge models from open AI available within it.,2023
10189,"And second, we infused some of our user research and design teams with specialist expertise that had previously been centered in one particular team.",2023
10190,"So, you know, the way I think about this is, you know, responsible AI has today been a journey and it will continue to be.",2023
10191,"So as we go forward, we know we need to learn and continue to evolve along the way, especially as governments now are starting to define more concrete policies and regulations that will govern this space.",2023
10192,"Now as we go, we're committed to sharing our learnings and making sure that we are learning from outside the company as well.",2023
10193,Brett Iversen: Yeah.,2023
10194,"Melanie Nakagawa: Her governance point is just so important because on sustainability, we share many of the same important issues.",2023
10195,"So on governance for sustainability, you know, we've had the, I guess, privilege and opportunity to have our commitments announced by Satya and Amy Hood and Brad Smith in 2020, really demonstrating the executive sponsorship for our commitment.",2023
10196,"And then from a governance perspective internally, Microsoft also charges a carbon fee, internally to our business groups that help us do the work on carbon removal and carbon reductions and really helps business groups see the opportunities in their own mitigation plans and reduction plans.",2023
10197,So I couldn't underscore that point enough about the importance of the internal governance that allows us to frankly move forward in both of our key issues.,2023
10198,Brett Iversen: Yeah.,2023
10199,"Resonated with me too, yeah, Thank you.",2023
10200,"Well, we'll stay here.",2023
10201,I know you're newer to Microsoft.,2023
10202,"Maybe a little bit on, you know, what brought you here and how you think about helping the company reach the ambitious sustainability commitments and how you see the work evolving over time.",2023
10203,"Melanie Nakagawa: Yes, I am.",2023
10204,I am still relatively new here.,2023
10205,Brett Iversen: We're recording this.,2023
10206,"So this, you know.",2023
10207,"Melanie Nakagawa: Yes, I am still relatively new here and it has first been just an incredible privilege and a pleasure to join in a company that has been at frankly one of the forefronts of leading on ambitious commitments around sustainability and matching that with actions.",2023
10208,And that annual report we do each year is really just chock full of the specific projects and actions and initiatives where we're investing.,2023
10209,"You know how I got here, so my background is I've been a policy maker, a diplomat, an investor in a private equity fund.",2023
10210,"Working with also, you know, tech companies around the world.",2023
10211,"And part of what brought me here is really bringing the nexus of technology, policy, and finance all together from a sustainability perspective.",2023
10212,And how do we leverage those experiences that I've had into the role of sustainability all up at Microsoft?,2023
10213,And so that was part of the journey to get here and what led to it.,2023
10214,"Also in terms of kind of where we go from here, you know, this past few months has really been about learning, you know, about Microsoft's journey to get to its 2030 goals and making those investments.",2023
10215,"Every day, I wake up to our policy team in Washington, D.C. who helps inform us about what's happening both in the US and in Europe and around the world on policy actions that are helping to drive the sustainability agenda.",2023
10216,"You know, we are really benefiting from the fact that in 2015, the world governments got together and said, ""We are committed to, you know, no greater than two-degree Celsius warming future for the world.”

And that's really important.",2023
10217,"And you know, we now, since 2015, governments have been putting in place policies, initiatives, and actions and companies have been stepping up.",2023
10218,"That's helping drive businesses for us to participate in on sustainability, but also helping to drive these commitments to actually meeting the goals that we need for our planet.",2023
10219,So it's been quite a journey so far and I'm excited to be here.,2023
10220,"Brett Iversen: Yeah, good.",2023
10221,"Well, we're happy to have you.",2023
10222,"Yeah, so we've already talked a bit about how Microsoft operationalizes your responsible AI commitments, but if we can get a little deeper into just the governance and management, these issues.",2023
10223,"We get a lot of questions on this, like what's the board involvement?",2023
10224,How does your team work with Microsoft leadership and even the broader org to achieve our goals?,2023
10225,"So you know, Natasha, can you help with this?",2023
10226,Natasha Crampton: Sure.,2023
10227,"So it's really not a cliche to say that for responsible AI to be meaningful, it really starts at the top.",2023
10228,"So at Microsoft, our Chairman and CEO, Satya Nadella, supported the creation of our Responsible AI Council to oversee our efforts across the company.",2023
10229,"Now the council is chaired by Vice Chair and President Brad Smith, to whom I report, and also Kevin Scott, who's our Chief Technology Officer.",2023
10230,"Kevin's in charge of setting the technology vision for the company, as well as overseeing Microsoft Research.",2023
10231,"Now I think for me, this joint leadership is really core to our efforts because what it does is it sends a very clear message that Microsoft is not just going to be a leader in the technology of AI, but Microsoft is going be a leader in responsible AI.",2023
10232,Now the Responsible AI Council convenes regularly and it brings together representatives of each of the policy and engineering and research groups that are dedicated to responsible AI.,2023
10233,"This includes the Office of Responsible AI that I lead, and our AETHER Committee, and we also bring together senior business partners.",2023
10234,These are our partners who are responsible for the implementation of our program in their teams.,2023
10235,"For my part, I find those council meetings to be both challenging and refreshing, but they're challenging because we are working on a hard set of problems and progress is not always linear.",2023
10236,"Yet, we know we've got to confront the difficult questions and make sure that we are driving accountability.",2023
10237,The meetings are refreshing because there is just this collective energy and wisdom among the members of the Responsible AI Council.,2023
10238,And I often come away with fresh ideas about how we can advance the state-of-the-art.,2023
10239,"And to your specific question, Brett, about the board, the Environmental, Social and Public Policy Committee of the board provides oversight of our responsible AI program.",2023
10240,So we have regular engagements with the committee and that really makes sure that we are bringing the full rigor of Microsoft's enterprise risk management program to our responsible AI work.,2023
10241,"Melanie Nakagawa: Actually, similarly, that ESPP Committee of the board also provides oversight for our sustainability work as well.",2023
10242,Brett Iversen: Love it.,2023
10243,Our investors love hearing that.,2023
10244,So thank you both.,2023
10245,"Melanie, there's so much discussion on the challenging topic of Scope 3 emissions and how we address that and, you know, for our audience, and maybe not be as familiar, you know, there's greenhouse gas emissions that aren't from a company's own sources or it's purchased electricity, but you know, rather from across the entire value chain, you know, going upstream and downstream to customers that are using our products.",2023
10246,"So, how do we think at Microsoft about this challenge and what are we doing to help ourselves and others address it?",2023
10247,Because you know we don't have direct control of that.,2023
10248,I'm sure it's a challenging topic.,2023
10249,"Melanie Nakagawa: Well, great.",2023
10250,Your knowledge of Scope 3 is fantastic.,2023
10251,"Brett Iversen: Yeah, that's right.",2023
10252,"I studied, I studied.",2023
10253,Melanie Nakagawa: So at Microsoft we are in the implementation stage of our sustainability journey all up and you really highlighted a key part.,2023
10254,So Scope 3 why are we fixated on it?,2023
10255,Why is something that you need to know about?,2023
10256,Scope 3 for Microsoft is around 96% of our overall emissions.,2023
10257,Brett Iversen: Wow.,2023
10258,"Melanie Nakagawa: The Scopes 1 and 2, around 4%.",2023
10259,So Scope 3 is ultimately our decarbonization challenge and our opportunity.,2023
10260,It necessitates the co-evolution of the best practices from businesses and technology and policy among thousands of global stakeholders.,2023
10261,"When we made the carbon negative commitment in 2020, it wasn't just a challenge to support sustainability of our business, it was also an invitation for the world to participate in this journey, translating this into action and then action into impact.",2023
10262,A major roadblock in our way is what we call the hard-to-abate emissions sectors.,2023
10263,This is like materials.,2023
10264,Think concrete.,2023
10265,A prime example of this is our growing sources of Scope 3 emissions.,2023
10266,"One other example in addition to concrete is semiconductors, chips.",2023
10267,"The global manufacturing of semiconductors could probably account for, by some estimates, 3% of overall greenhouse gas emissions by 2040.",2023
10268,"And one big challenge is that they are manufactured in countries such as South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan, where clean energy is just not abundant to service those types of manufacturing facilities.",2023
10269,"So decarbonizing semiconductors and other hard-to-abate sectors such as concrete and materials really depends on transitioning the world to more cleaner energy sources, cleaner grids, cleaner infrastructure.",2023
10270,"In the future, the countries that build and operate the cleanest grids, we really believe are going to have a competitive advantage.",2023
10271,Those economies will really be serving customers like us who really want to see our purchasing be tied to those that are aligned with our commitments.,2023
10272,"Those countries where Microsoft and others have ambitious climate commitments, those are the countries that we're going to want to invest in and procure from.",2023
10273,"So, another way we're addressing this challenge with semiconductors and other materials, is through Microsoft's billion-dollar Climate Innovation Fund.",2023
10274,This fund is investing in technologies and companies from all stages in renewable electricity to low carbon materials.,2023
10275,We also invest in a fund called the Southeast Asia Clean Energy Facility.,2023
10276,And this helps build renewable energy projects throughout the region.,2023
10277,Another company that's really exciting to highlight is called Prometheus Materials.,2023
10278,They produce a microalgae-based concrete for buildings that sequester carbon during the manufacturing process.,2023
10279,So this technology is estimated to reduce carbon intensity by up to 90% compared to traditional units.,2023
10280,Another similar company is called Carbon Cure.,2023
10281,They produce low carbon concrete by injecting carbon dioxide into the concrete during the mixing where it mineralizes and strengthens the product and reduces the overall emissions.,2023
10282,"These types of investments you could see, you know, appearing in physical infrastructure and other types of infrastructure out there.",2023
10283,"And that just means when you compare that to traditional, you're actually choosing a more climate friendly, a lower carbon product potentially, you know, a better product at the end of the day.",2023
10284,So these are the types of innovations we've been investing in and thinking about.,2023
10285,Brett Iversen: It's fascinating.,2023
10286,Those are some cutting edge examples.,2023
10287,"It's interesting to hear about, you know, especially from somebody who spends his time on the finance side of the house.",2023
10288,So thank you for that.,2023
10289,"You know, Natasha, similarly in your space, there's obviously huge interest.",2023
10290,Every question since this calendar year started for our IR team has included AI as a topic.,2023
10291,"You know, given the recent advances in the generative AI that we are incorporating across all of our products and services, what responsible AI issues are unique to generative AI and how's the company working to address those?",2023
10292,"Natasha Crampton: Well, first let me say that, you know, I'm very happy that we've come to this generative AI moment with the benefit of seven years of responsible AI work up until this point, because that has allowed us to mature our governance systems, our tools, our practices, to get ready for this moment.",2023
10293,And there is much from our practice that we've been building up all of this time that's directly relevant to our generative AI work as well.,2023
10294,"So for our generative AI systems specifically, we do use state-of-the-art methods to make sure that we are identifying, measuring, and mitigating their risks.",2023
10295,"And as I said, this does build on this long experience that we've had of operating these large-scale enterprise and consumer services, and of course our deep partnership with OpenAI, as well.",2023
10296,That's been really critical.,2023
10297,Perhaps it's easiest to illustrate what some of the unique considerations are here by just using our new Bing implementation as an example of the sorts of things that we do.,2023
10298,"So as I mentioned, the first step in the process is to identify the risks of these new systems.",2023
10299,"For the new Bing, we did this through a process called red teaming.",2023
10300,What red teaming does is it allows you to bring together a multi-disciplinary team to really push on the edges of the system and understand where the challenges are.,2023
10301,Now the thing about red teaming is it's a bit like identifying an iceberg ahead.,2023
10302,"It's very important that you understand that that iceberg is there, but you don't really understand the size and the shape of what you're dealing with.",2023
10303,"So having engaged in red teaming on the core components of the system, especially the new model that came from OpenAI, we then moved to a systematic approach to measurement where we could start to measure what is the size and shape of those icebergs, which are really different types of risk surfaces that we can have for these new systems.",2023
10304,Then we move on to a mitigation phase.,2023
10305,And the purpose of that phase is to really think about what are the layered approaches that we can adopt to mitigating the risk of these systems.,2023
10306,"And in many ways, we really use a defense in depth type of approach, similar to what you might think of in the security context.",2023
10307,"So we make sure that we not only bake safety right into the model at the core of the system, but we wrap safety around in different layers on top of that as well.",2023
10308,"So some of the core issues that we addressed as part of this identify, measure, mitigate process included making sure that the responses that you would get from the new Bing would be grounded in Bing search results.",2023
10309,Sometimes people refer to errors that generative AI systems make as hallucinations.,2023
10310,"For us, we think of those as being situations where we have not grounded the response in Bing's search results.",2023
10311,It was a huge help to us here that we had the Bing infrastructure to leverage.,2023
10312,So we've taken a number of steps there.,2023
10313,"We've also made sure that using some of our past fairness related work, we have made sure that, you know, Bing is not producing responses that might be reinforcing stereotypes or otherwise being unfair.",2023
10314,"So those are just a couple of examples of both how we have leveraged our past work, but we've layered new mitigations and techniques on top of that.",2023
10315,And I feel confident that we'll continue to build out those systems and harness those learnings.,2023
10316,I think our incremental release strategies where we've carefully controlled the release of these new technologies have been extremely beneficial and that those will be a core part of our approach going forward.,2023
10317,"Brett Iversen: Yeah, I love that in all of the different responsible AI sharing that you've given us, there's this cross-discipline element, you know, in what I've heard on most of these.",2023
10318,"You know, it's not something we're just doing on the side.",2023
10319,"It's embedded with all of the functions, and it's a very integrated and cohesive conversation, which I think is critical.",2023
10320,So it's come out in all of the different topics.,2023
10321,"You know, given that, and I'm still just picturing us injecting concrete like I need to learn all this stuff.",2023
10322,"Given that we have the two of you together, which again I appreciate, what can you tell me about how you see, you know, AI and sustainability interacting in the future?",2023
10323,"We get questions on both, but as you think about the concepts together, you know, potential harms of rapid AI transformation to our, you know, environmental commitments or we're flipping it, what are the promises of AI?",2023
10324,And maybe that's an accelerant for global sustainability.,2023
10325,So how would the two of you help me think about that?,2023
10326,"And maybe Melanie, you can start us off on this one.",2023
10327,"Melanie Nakagawa: Thanks, great.",2023
10328,We believe AI is an essential part of building a net zero future.,2023
10329,AI is already playing a role in improving sustainability management as well as measurement and accountability.,2023
10330,When you think about there's this really kind of awesome potential of what the opportunity set is with using AI.,2023
10331,"So to pick up on a theme from earlier, concrete and cement.",2023
10332,We are seeing how the use of AI can really accelerate rapidly the discovery of alternative materials to high carbon materials such as cement.,2023
10333,"So if you think about it, AI can reduce the design and validation process for new materials by an order of magnitude and can lead to faster innovation in these materials such as low carbon concrete that can be used in building materials for things such as our data centers and reducing the overall environmental footprint and carbon footprint to those data centers.",2023
10334,The AI provides an opportunity to go from the trial-and-error process to really rapid iteration.,2023
10335,"We've also used AI and partner with it to create satellite imagery that produces first of its kind atlas, a living atlas, if you will, to map the world and measure the utility scale solar and wind installations on the planet, allowing users to evaluate clean energy transition progress in different parts of the world and different countries and track that over time.",2023
10336,"This tool is called the Global Renewables Watch, and it's a partnership between The Nature Conservancy, a nonprofit, and Planet.",2023
10337,And it really provides unique spatial data on land use trends to help achieve the dual aims of environmental protection and increasing renewable energy capacity around the world.,2023
10338,"While the prospects for AI to advance sustainability are tremendous, the second thing we must also think about is the other side of the ledger.",2023
10339,So on one side you have the amazing potential for AI to accelerate our clean energy transition and sustainability goals.,2023
10340,And on the other side we have to also recognize that these AI models use more energy for scaled compute.,2023
10341,"So we are committed to not only bringing on additional energy onto grids around the world, but also working to ensure that that energy is coming from carbon-free resources of electricity.",2023
10342,"Microsoft today is already one of the largest purchasers, corporate purchasers of renewable power, and we're helping to advance innovative commitments to carbon-free energy sources, like a contract we announced with a fusion energy company called Helion back in May.",2023
10343,"We're also investing in research to measure the energy use and carbon impact of AI and working on ways to help make large AI systems more efficient through things such as the green software initiative, reducing the energy consumption through more efficient compute and network traffic.",2023
10344,Brett Iversen: Perfect.,2023
10345,"Natasha, can you add to this interesting fusion between these two concepts?",2023
10346,"Natasha Crampton: Well, I think Melanie did capture the key points very, very well.",2023
10347,"I mean, I do think it's essential that we use AI to address the biggest challenges of our time, and of course that includes sustainability as well.",2023
10348,And I'm also really grateful that Melanie's leading the charge for making sure that we are proactively addressing the energy needs of the compute demands for these new AI models.,2023
10349,That work to better define the questions and also undertake further research is also critically important.,2023
10350,We do need to deeply understand the problem space here and make sure that we are working towards finding answers that are durable going forward.,2023
10351,One other dimension that I'll perhaps add is that in May we released our five-point blueprint for AI governance.,2023
10352,"And part of that blueprint was recognizing that as this technology moves forward, it's just as important to make sure that we have proper control over AI as it is to make sure that we are realizing its benefits.",2023
10353,"So one of the specific points that we recommended was that we thought that for AI systems that are controlling critical infrastructure, they should have safety brakes.",2023
10354,"So we can think of these systems, which the government would need to define a class of, as systems that might be controlling our electricity grids or our water supply.",2023
10355,"And similar to the safety protocols that we've put in place for other very important core technologies, we need to put these brakes in for AI systems as well.",2023
10356,So you might think of the safety brakes that we've put in for elevators or school buses or high-speed trains.,2023
10357,"Conceptually, we need the same AI safety brakes for critical infrastructure as well.",2023
10358,Brett Iversen: Makes sense.,2023
10359,"We've covered a lot of ground in a short period of time, so thank you both.",2023
10360,"You know, as we close out, if you can each share a little bit about how you think about the future in each of your areas and, you know, thoughts for the road I would say for our group.",2023
10361,And Melanie if you can start us off.,2023
10362,Melanie Nakagawa: Sure.,2023
10363,"Well, the future, so we are optimistic.",2023
10364,"I'm an optimist by nature, but we really feel good about the businesses that we are investing in, that we're purchasing from.",2023
10365,And we're confident in our strategies and remain committed to reaching our 2030 commitments.,2023
10366,And we're going to continue to help build the foundation for 2030 by doing a few things.,2023
10367,"So first we're going to be advancing public-private partnerships, advocating for favorable clean energy policy to bring more carbon free energy to the grid, and investing in countries that build and operate the cleanest grids.",2023
10368,"Second, we're going to leverage our role as one of the largest corporate purchasers of clean energy and renewable energy.",2023
10369,"We're going to be building markets for the things that we need and procure from, and we're going to find opportunities to diversify and scale up supply, advance the development of sustainability markets for water replenishment, for carbon removal.",2023
10370,"And then third, we're going to be improving corporate governance, sustainability and accounting to ensure that sustainability reporting readiness is really top of our priority list for the sustainability team.",2023
10371,We want to make sure we're developing effective carbon accounting standards and initiatives that really underpin that reporting readiness.,2023
10372,"And then lastly, we're going to be helping to realize the potential of this next gen AI to build innovative climate solutions that we need.",2023
10373,We believe that innovation is a critical component to solving the climate crisis and that investment of capital plays an important role in accelerating the availability of these new solutions that may not be ready for the market today or commercially at scale.,2023
10374,"So through the Climate Innovation Fund, which is a billion-dollar investment fund, we are really looking to use the CIF to help advance and create some of those markets.",2023
10375,"We're going to be investing in, and we have continued to invest in, innovative technologies and business models that have the potential to produce really meaningful measurable climate impact by 2030.",2023
10376,"Since the founding of the CIF in 2020, Microsoft has allocated more than 600 million of that billion into around 50 investments.",2023
10377,"That includes sustainable solutions in energy, in industrial systems, in natural systems.",2023
10378,"And we're really looking forward, from a global perspective, to continue to advocate for public policies that confront and accelerate climate action, that we want to invest in mitigation and adaptation resilience and ensuring that this is a just transition for all that are involved.",2023
10379,We also want to make sure that we're aligning the international climate reporting and disclosure requirements that are coming out to ensure that they align with sustainability measurements and really are implementable.,2023
10380,"It's really critical that companies, non-governmental organizations, and governments all work together to ensure consistent, robust, and interoperable standards, especially around greenhouse gases.",2023
10381,"Those reporting metrics are really critical, and what's exciting is that digital technologies play a really important role in not only calculating those emissions, tracking those emissions, and ultimately reporting those in a digital ledger.",2023
10382,New sustainability reporting requirements are already on the way.,2023
10383,"So earlier this year, the European Commission passed the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, the CSRD.",2023
10384,"And this directive is really significant for many companies, not just for Microsoft.",2023
10385,"And in the case of the CSRD, over 50,000 companies are likely being affected by this new reporting requirement.",2023
10386,"So really dedicated to helping manage our own reporting requirements, but also using our technology and data platforms to help scale ESG reporting and performance demands for our customers.",2023
10387,"Through the Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability, for example, we're delivering new data management capabilities to improve regulatory reporting, governance, and accountability, and drive sustainability progress from both the data management solution play to also AI integration reporting templates and automation going forward.",2023
10388,Brett Iversen: Nice.,2023
10389,Natasha?,2023
10390,"Natasha Crampton: For my part, I'm enormously optimistic about the future of AI and I'm confident that Microsoft is uniquely well placed to lead in this moment.",2023
10391,"We have spent significant time and resources to be ready to build and deploy AI responsibly, but we also recognize that we are just one company here.",2023
10392,"We will do our part, but it will take a whole of society approach here.",2023
10393,"We need to come together to define those right guardrails, to secure those beneficial uses, but also to guard against the misuse of AI technology as well.",2023
10394,"We're engaged with governments around the world as well as civil society organizations, academics, industry partners, our own customers and partners here at Microsoft as well.",2023
10395,So I'm confident that our commitment at Microsoft to responsible AI is steadfast.,2023
10396,"If we keep humans at the center of our efforts and we are willing to be humble and to learn, we as a company can continue to move forward, nimbly and responsibly to really advance this transformative new technology.",2023
10397,"Brett Iversen: Yeah, thank you both so much.",2023
10398,"I know how many questions we get from investors, and I can only imagine how many you're getting across all of the things that you do.",2023
10399,"So I know you're both very busy, so I appreciate the time and we thank everyone for watching.",2023
10400,"You know, ESG, as you've heard, is built into everything that we do as a company and we're glad we had some time to talk to you about it today.",2023

10456,"Yet, the line often can feel blurred between what types of companies are found in a traditional fund compared with a fund that takes explicit ESG approaches.",2023
10457,"We compared a variety of portfolios and found three stocks that large-cap ESG funds own at much higher exposures than their traditional counterparts: Microsoft MSFT, Nvidia NVDA, and Intuit INTU.",2023

10459,"We include our assessments below from Morningstar analysts as well as from Morningstar Sustainalytics, a Morningstar company that provides ESG data and solutions.",2023
10460,"Our Methodology

Generally, sustainable equity funds approach portfolio construction much the same as traditional fund managers, by searching for quality investments with long-term capital appreciation prospects and unique risk and return characteristics.",2023
10461,"Like all funds, these sustainable equity managers seek to outperform their benchmarks, minimize risk, and protect and expand their portfolios.",2023
10462,"On top of that, sustainable funds also use ESG data and metrics to pursue their objectives.",2023
10463,These approaches can vary.,2023
10464,One approach might be excluding investments based on moral values.,2023
10465,"Others include limiting ESG risk, seeking ESG opportunities, or targeting sustainability themes.",2023
10466,"(For a full list, please check out the Morningstar Sustainable-Investing Framework.)",2023

10468,"As you might expect, there is also evidence of differing strategies when you analyze the distribution of weights among the holdings of both types of funds.",2023
10469,Here’s what we did to compare the funds.,2023
10470,"For large-cap ESG funds, we aggregated the holdings of the oldest share classes of all U.S. sustainable large-cap funds.",2023
10471,We took the 200 securities that were most commonly owned and then calculated what the average weight of each stock might be in a theoretical portfolio that owned all 200 stocks.,2023
10472,Each stock’s weight in the model was determined by taking its average weight and dividing it by the sum of the top 200 stocks’ average weights in the sustainable universe.,2023
10473,"As an example, if Microsoft had an average weight across the universe of 15%, and the sum of the 200 highest average weighted securities in the universe was 350%, Microsoft would have a model weight of 4.3%.",2023
10474,"This process for model creation was then repeated for the “traditional universe.” The traditional universe was defined for large-cap funds as the oldest share classes of U.S. large-cap funds, excluding sustainable funds.",2023
10475,"Our objective is to gain insights into the unique or underweight securities held by sustainable funds in the large-, mid-, and small-cap universes.",2023
10476,Securities in the sustainable model that hold a greater position than the traditional model are considered “overweight” in this study.,2023

10485,"Except for Amazon.com AMZN and Alphabet GOOGL, these market-cap giants (which also include Apple AAPL, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla) are overweight in the sustainable model as compared with the traditional model.",2023
10486,Why so much overlap?,2023
10487,"The explanation lies in tracking error, a measure of volatility between a fund and its index.",2023
10488,"“Most sustainable large-blend funds still aim to be suitable as core portfolio holdings, meaning that their performance should be similar to large-blend benchmarks,” says Alyssa Stankiewicz, Morningstar’s associate director for sustainability research.",2023
10489,"“To fully exclude a name such as Microsoft or Apple, which are large portions of the market, an ESG-focused fund would be courting significant performance differences compared with traditional benchmarks.”

Thus, it’s common for active ESG-focused portfolio managers to hold slightly more or slightly less in a given name.",2023
10490,"In the example above, Microsoft has a slightly higher weighting in our model compared with the Morningstar US Large Cap Index, which makes sense given Microsoft’s relatively good standing on ESG matters compared with industry peers, corresponding to a Morningstar ESG Risk Rating Assessment of Low.",2023

10983,It can be hazardous these days for companies to speak out publicly on ESG matters.,2023
10984,Ask AB InBev and Disney.,2023
10985,"But Microsoft’s Melanie Nakagawa did just that this week, and feels good about it, thank you very much.",2023
10986,"Nakagawa, the company’s chief sustainability officer, this week called on “all governments to adopt firm carbon and electricity policy positions.” Such policies, geared to accelerate the green energy transition, should allow companies—including Microsoft—to succeed in their journey to net zero.",2023
10987,"“The world needs access to more carbon-free energy,” she wrote.",2023
10988,"“We ALL need to mobilize.”

In the politicized ESG landscape today, it’s a bet, but Nakagawa doesn’t see a problem.",2023
10989,"“Taking a stand on relevant policy issues, like climate change, is part of our core business,” she told me.",2023
10990,"“We want to—and do—use our voice to advocate for the policies that we think the world needs.”

So far, so sensible.",2023
10991,"Then again, BlackRock, Vanguard, and many others surely at one point felt the same.",2023
10992,"Then they got caught in the political crossfire over climate policies, faced bans, and changed tack.",2023
10993,"Does Microsoft’s stance open a new chapter in the discussion on whether and how companies, especially those with $2 trillion in market capital, can and should weigh on public policy related to ESG?",2023
10994,"Nakagawa, who I met earlier this year at Davos, believes following a checklist with three criteria should help Microsoft avoid a similar fate.",2023
10995,"Before speaking out, the company asks itself the following questions, she said:

– Is it a policy issue that impacts our customers and their use of our or similar technology?",2023
10996,– Is it an issue that impacts our employees and their ability to work and live in the community?,2023
10997,– Does it impact the rest of our business?,2023
10998,"If the answer to all three is yes, it’s a go.",2023
10999,"“If you take a principled approach and apply the criteria articulated above,” she said, “it benefits our core stakeholders, including our shareholders.”

Still, the global public good may not be the only reason why Microsoft now takes such a muscular stance on climate policies around the world.",2023
11000,"In the company’s latest environmental sustainability report, issued the same day as Nakagawa’s call to accelerate the green energy transition, the company had to admit its progress towards net zero was too sluggish.",2023
11001,"“While Microsoft’s business grew by 18% year over year in 2022, our emissions declined by 0.5%,” Nakagawa said.",2023
11002,"“While this can be counted as progress, it’s not happening fast enough because 96% of these emissions come from a global energy grid that is most difficult to us […] to control.”

Seen from that perspective, Microsoft’s muscular take on green energy policy starts to look more like a defensive play to shield it from criticism of its publicly announced target from 2020.",2023
11003,"At that time, the company declared it would be “carbon negative by 2030,” with an intermediary goal of reducing its emissions by much more than 0.5% per year.",2023
11004,"Nakagawa, who joined the company last December after a stint in the White House as special assistant to President Joe Biden and senior director for climate and energy on the National Security Council, can’t be held accountable for those overly optimistic goals.",2023
11005,"But she acknowledges that without a policy boost, Microsoft’s future sustainability reports will not look as rosy—or green—as the company had said they would.",2023
11006,And she plans to take ownership.,2023

11026,"Initially a series of webinars, the programme is available free for everyone and is targeted at the general public, sustainability professionals and IT employees who may need training on the Microsoft Sustainability Manager Platform, an extensible solution that unifies data intelligence with automated sustainability management, for recording, reporting and reducing emissions.",2023

11028,Microsoft has committed to eliminating Scopes 1 and 2 emissions by 2025 and achieving carbon negativity across all scopes by 2030.,2023
11029,"Born from Microsoft’s own sustainability commitments, the Sustainability Academy will build awareness as well as help professionals hone their abilities, assist attendees to understand supply chain risk and opportunities, and lay out roadmaps for strategising, implementing and monitoring their ESG programmes.",2023

11031,"The World Economic Forum claims that if brought to scale, digital technologies could reduce emissions by 20 per cent by 2050 across the energy, materials and mobility sectors, while according to the LSE, digitalisation and artificial intelligence have a key role to play in enabling the optimal operation of energy systems, and reducing energy demand by cutting avoidable consumption.",2023
11032,"And during the Cop27 climate summit in Egypt in late 2022, attendees agreed that a smarter approach to technology was one of the main pillars for countries to leverage in order to reduce their carbon footprints.",2023

11038,"To make the most of these technologies, businesses need to know how to implement them.",2023
11039,They also need to be able to build an internal culture that understands why sustainability is so important.,2023

Foreword

It’s hard to ignore the effects of climate change.",2022
11538,"In recent weeks, a heavy blanket of smoke from nearby wildfires has enveloped the region I call home, an eerie phenomenon that has become an unfortunate seasonal event in the Pacific Northwest of the United States.",2022
11539,"At the same time, the American West and parts of Europe are experiencing historic drought.",2022
11540,"And halfway around the world, Pakistan is recovering from catastrophic summer floods that killed 1,500 people, displaced 33 million more and caused $40 billion in ruin.",2022
11541,All devastating events.,2022
11542,And all believed to be fueled by climate change.,2022
11543,"The gravity of the problem has led more than 3,900 companies, including Microsoft, to announce climate pledges.",2022
11544,"As we work, internally and with a large majority of these companies, it’s clear that the coming business changes will be massive.",2022
11545,"They will impact a wide variety of processes and operations, in part based on new applications for digital technology, including cloud services, AI and dedicated services like our Cloud for Sustainability.",2022
11546,"But, as we’ve learned, this will also require an equally vital effort to equip companies and employees with a broad range of new skills needed for climate adaptation and sustainability transformation.",2022
11547,The historical importance and current breadth of the sustainability skilling challenge are difficult to overstate.,2022
11548,A clear analogy has emerged from our study of the issue.,2022
11549,Humanity’s initial quest to reach the moon required the spread of physics into a broadly accessible academic discipline across the United States.,2022
11550,The world’s entry into the digital age then required that computer science move into every school.,2022
11551,"In a similar way, the creation of a net zero planet will require that sustainability science spreads into every sector of the economy.",2022
11552,That’s the focus of this report.,2022
11553,"During the past year, Microsoft and Boston Consulting Group (BCG) studied the work of 15 companies at the forefront of sustainability innovation and change – including across Microsoft itself.",2022
11554,Our teams interviewed or surveyed nearly 250 employees whose jobs have sustainability commitments.,2022
11555,We identified new jobs that have emerged.,2022
11556,We studied the impact on the many jobs that existed before.,2022
11557,And we considered what our data says about in-demand knowledge and skills.,2022
11558,The impact on jobs across companies falls into two broad categories.,2022
11559,The first is specialized sustainability positions emerging quickly across the global economy.,2022
11560,"For example, a company like Microsoft now employs individuals who pursue full time the purchase of long-term, high-quality carbon removal.",2022
11561,"The second is much broader, as existing jobs expand to encompass sustainability subject matter.",2022
11562,A good example involves engineers and materials scientists who design hardware devices.,2022
11563,They now have to assess not only the capabilities of materials that go into a new device but also the sustainability implications of those materials.,2022
11564,"As companies move to create and fill these jobs, they are confronting a huge sustainability skills gap.",2022
11565,This gap encompasses three categories.,2022
11566,"First, some employees need deep and specialized sustainability knowledge and skills in areas like carbon accounting, carbon removal and ecosystem services valuation.",2022
11567,This includes the skills needed to address these issues through new climate-specific digital tools.,2022
11568,"Second, broader business teams need readier access to more limited but sometimes deep knowledge in specific sustainability subject areas, such as climate-related issues that have become important for procurement and supply chain management.",2022
11569,"Third, a great many employees need basic and broader fluency in sustainability issues and climate science fields that impact a wide variety of business operations and processes.",2022
11570,"Ultimately, it’s important to recognize that the sustainability transformation will need people who can combine specialized sustainability knowledge and skills with varying degrees of other multidisciplinary skill sets.",2022
11571,"These will need to combine knowledge from STEM and other fields in the liberal arts and encompass skills that span across business, the use of data, and digital technology.",2022
11572,This combination currently is hard to find and often doesn’t exist naturally.,2022
11573,"Perhaps unsurprisingly, we’ve also learned that the sustainability skills gap is creating an increasing sense of anxiety for business leaders.",2022
11574,This reflects not only the enormity of the climate crisis but two other factors as well.,2022
11575,"First, there are growing public expectations that companies will turn their climate pledges into progress.",2022
11576,"In the next 24 months, regulators in multiple countries will likely require that public companies report their carbon emissions.",2022
11577,"A great many businesses are not yet equipped with the skilled personnel, business processes and data systems needed for this step.",2022
11578,"Business leaders understandably fear that, if their reports are incomplete or show a lack of progress, they will confront growing public criticism.",2022
11579,"Second, this pressure for performance is growing while economic concerns are rising.",2022
11580,Economic turbulence is putting added pressure on companies to find new ways to do more with less.,2022
11581,"In some instances, companies may even be tempted to postpone or forego new business initiatives, including pursuing their climate pledges.",2022
11582,Yet ongoing scientific observations and data show that the world cannot afford to wait.,2022
11583,"In late October, new reports underscored the need for accelerated action.",2022
11584,"In particular, the United Nations Environment Programme made clear in its annual Emissions Gap report that current national climate plans fall short of what will be needed to meet the world’s climate targets.",2022
11585,Clearly the business community will need to do more.,2022
11586,Other institutions must as well.,2022
11587,"Climate pledges and performance are equally important for every organization on the planet, including nonprofits and even government institutions themselves.",2022
11588,"In short, we’re all in this together, and we need to come together to chart a successful path forward, including by investing in sustainability skills.",2022
11589,"Yet, today, the gap between sustainability workforce needs and the number of qualified people available is growing.",2022
11590,"According to the LinkedIn Green Jobs report, green jobs grew at an annual rate of 8% between 2015 and 2021, while the talent pool grew at only 6%.",2022
11591,"As these figures reflect, progress is underway, but it’s not moving fast enough.",2022
11592,"To date, most companies at the forefront of sustainability transformation have been scrappy, growing the “home-grown” talent they need.",2022
11593,Our research found that employers so far have tapped 68% of their sustainability leaders by hiring from within their own company.,2022
11594,Some 60% of sustainability team members joined without expertise in the field.,2022
11595,"Employers mostly have tapped talented insiders with the core transformational and functional skill sets needed to create change in a company, even though they lacked formal training in sustainability.",2022
11596,They then upskilled those individuals to accomplish critical sustainability work.,2022
11597,The biggest problem with this approach is that it will not scale to meet either the business community’s or the planet’s needs.,2022
11598,"As we look at the roughly 3,900 companies that have made climate pledges, it’s readily apparent that the work to turn these pledges into progress will require far more talent with sustainability skills and fluency than currently is being trained within these companies’ businesses.",2022
11599,How do we move further and faster?,2022
11600,"This is a fundamental question, and we offer in this report both some suggestions and a commitment as a company to do more.",2022
11601,Progress will be needed in three areas.,2022
11602,"First, we all need to work together to develop a shared understanding, based on better data, regarding evolving jobs and the sustainability knowledge and skills needed for them.",2022
11603,"Currently, data remains spotty.",2022
11604,"We need a better and common taxonomy and framework that builds on recent sustainability work by international organizations, national governments, and private companies.",2022
11605,"As described in our report, we believe sustainability skilling can borrow from recent advances to address cybersecurity skilling to help create a better roadmap linking specific sustainability skills, training, jobs and career paths.",2022
11606,Work will be needed from a broad array of stakeholders.,2022
11607,"To develop a shared understanding of sustainability workforce needs, Microsoft and LinkedIn will support efforts to define skills and competencies and enable the mapping of sustainability skills and jobs as they evolve.",2022
11608,"We will achieve this in part through partnerships with organizations like the International Labour Organization and our work with the Development Data Partnership, which includes the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the World Bank, Inter-American Development Bank (IADB), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other multilateral organizations.",2022
11609,"Second, employers must move quickly to upskill their workforce through learning initiatives focused on sustainability knowledge and skills.",2022
11610,"This will require support from a variety of learning partners, including educational institutions, vocational education providers, apprenticeship programs and online training providers.",2022
11611,This work must start with the development of new learning materials that can be used both in person and online.,2022
11612,This must be supported by expanded learning initiatives to reach employees in companies and more broadly across the workforce.,2022
11613,There is an opportunity for government policy and funding to help scale these efforts.,2022
11614,"To support this work, Microsoft will work with partners to develop and share new sustainability learning materials.",2022
11615,These will include LinkedIn Learning paths for sustainability as well as business-focused sustainability materials provided through Microsoft’s Sustainability Learning Center and our Cloud Solution Center.,2022
11616,"Additionally, we are forming new partnerships with NGOs to help workers, including those in impacted and transitioning communities, to complete sustainability learning pathways.",2022
11617,"This will include a partnership with INCO Academy to launch a Green Digital Skills course to support up to 10,000 learners, including in the Global South.",2022
11618,We will also work with our customers to create a network and advanced forum to share new learning and best practices to transform sustainability practices and reduce carbon emissions.,2022
11619,This will include a new and focused forum for chief sustainability officers.,2022
11620,"Third, the world must prepare the next generation of workers for the sustainability jobs of the future.",2022
11621,"Just as governments, NGOs and companies have worked to bring digital skilling and computer science into schools, we will need similar partnerships to bring sustainability fluency and science into primary and secondary schools.",2022
11622,And higher education institutions will need to strengthen and expand their undergraduate and graduate sustainability programs.,2022
11623,"All these efforts can move faster if governments and public-private partnerships develop stronger sustainability programs through country-level networks and centers of excellence, foster international professional forums and communities of practice, and create real-world interdisciplinary learning opportunities for students.",2022
11624,"To support these efforts, Microsoft is committed to creating and providing new curricular and training materials that can be used by primary and secondary students.",2022
11625,"This will include our new Minecraft Frozen Planet II worlds, which we will present in partnership with BBC Earth at COP27.",2022
11626,"This adds to the Climate and Sustainability Subject Kit and Sustainability City learning map, available through Minecraft Education.",2022
11627,"In addition, Microsoft FarmBeats for Students will provide students with a hands-on experience to explore how big data, AI and machine learning apply to real-world sustainability challenges.",2022
11628,"Finally, we will join UNESCO’s Greening Education Partnership to deliver strong, coordinated action that will empower learners with the skills required for inclusive and sustainable economic development.",2022
11629,Microsoft will also invest in global capacity-building for post-secondary education.,2022
11630,"This will include a new partnership with the international research collaboration MECCE (Monitoring and Evaluating Climate Communication and Education) Project to support the implementation, monitoring and reporting of sustainability education worldwide.",2022
11631,"Additionally, we will partner with the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education, providing support to its Centers for Sustainability Across the Curriculum Program.",2022
11632,"The start of this decade has seen more than its share of crises, including the COVID pandemic, a war in Europe and growing economic uncertainty.",2022
11633,"Although we can’t predict when these current challenges will fade, it seems certain that the climate crisis will outlast all of them.",2022
11634,"For almost three centuries since the dawn of the industrial revolution, human ingenuity has produced remarkable inventions and unprecedented prosperity for much of the world.",2022
11635,But this has come from the use of fossil fuels that have produced carbon emissions at an unsustainable level.,2022
11636,Now we must move to a net zero world in which we both seek to eliminate net carbon emissions and expand global economic opportunity.,2022
11637,This will require sweeping changes in every sector of the economy in every country in the world.,2022
11638,And we must achieve all this in only three decades.,2022
11639,"In the history of civilization, few generations have needed to do as much in as little time as we must do now.",2022
11640,"At its most fundamental level, this is the single greatest challenge and opportunity of our time.",2022
11641,"Like the space age and digital era, the world’s sustainability transformation calls not only for a new generation of technology but a new generation of knowledge and skills.",2022
11642,"Clearly, no single entity can meet this challenge alone.",2022
11643,The key will be to partner broadly and effectively with others to move the world’s workforce into the future.,2022
11644,"We know the proposals in this report don’t have all the answers, but we believe the world must commit to a Global Sustainability Skilling Strategy based on a concerted and coordinated effort from companies, industry organizations, learning providers and governments.",2022
11645,And we are committed to doing our part.,2022
11646,"Tags: Skills, sustainability",2022
11647,"Anxious to meet international standards, satisfy investors, and profit from a growing array of sustainable products, financial services firms are intensifying their focus on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) goals.",2023
11648,"While the incentives for ESG are compelling, managing programs and demonstrating success are fraught with challenges.",2023
11649,"But by adhering to the right standards and using technology to better organize programs, financial firms can gain a clearer vision of their ESG operations and speed up progress toward their goals.",2023
11650,"Doing well by doing good

Many financial institutions are striving to align ESG programs with the United Nations’ 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which lists 17 goals designed to end global poverty and promote an equitable transition to a sustainable world.",2023
11651,"“Companies across the globe are adopting the 2030 Agenda and UN SDGs Framework to ensure sustainable investments and operations,” says Kishan Changlani, Partner for strategic initiatives – sustainable banking, at Tata Consultancy Services (TCS).",2023
11652,"Financial services firms can use the 2030 Agenda and UN SDGs Framework as a guide for allocating ESG funds, such as creating a “green economy” team dedicated to helping companies that produce environmentally friendly goods and services.",2023
11653,Leadership teams are also learning that ESG initiatives can boost business performance.,2023
11654,"One 2022 study found that organizations placing greater emphasis on ESG over the previous three years saw revenues increased by almost 10%, compared to 4.5% revenue growth from businesses showing a lower commitment to ESG.",2023
11655,"Overcoming data challenges

Despite their growing commitment to ESG, financial firms have learned the path to sustainability and prosperity can be rocky.",2023
11656,“ESG data quality is the biggest challenge.,2023
11657,"Quality at the least is about consistent data across asset classes, effective data for scenario planning, and harmonized ESG ratings amongst other aspects,” Changlani says.",2023
11658,"However, there are many other challenges as well, including regulatory requirements, human capital, stakeholder engagement, alignment of materiality and performance, and the need to embed ESG into an existing ERM (Enterprise Risk Management) framework.",2023
11659,"“The ESG regulatory landscape resembles an alphabet soup where the number of ESG standard-setters, data aggregators, analysis providers, ESG raters, and indices is increasing,” says Changlani.",2023
11660,"Financial services companies may also find it challenging to keep up with a broad scope of reporting requirements, resulting in a complex set of documents and deliverables that can lead to questions about a program’s validity or perception of greenwashing.",2023
11661,Technology can help banks and other financial institutions overcome these hurdles.,2023
11662,"For example, TCS has developed a suite of solutions on Microsoft Cloud to unify and integrate ESG metrics and accurately measure performance.",2023
11663,"Changlani also recommends that companies limit data vendors to two or three and establish their own ESG benchmarks, instead of relying solely on external providers.",2023
11664,Emerging technologies will further speed ESG progress.,2023
11665,AI and machine learning algorithms can monitor compliance in real time.,2023
11666,"With natural language processing, organizations can analyze millions of reports quickly, helping them avoid pitfalls associated with greenwashing and other discredited activities.",2023

By Patrice Amann, EMEA Regional Business Lead – WW Financial Services

Why connecting capital with businesses to shape a greener, more inclusive tomorrow is a data play

COP26 saw some important announcements around climate finance.",2021
11671,The Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero committed to cut the emissions from its lending and investing to zero by 2050.,2021
11672,The International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation launched an initiative to establish consistent climate disclosure standards for financial markets.,2021
11673,These are just two examples.,2021
11674,It is obvious that shifting the economy from fossil fuels to clean sources of energy requires a vast reallocation of capital.,2021
11675,"As Rishi Sunak, the UK Chancellor, pointed out during Finance Day at COP26:

“Investors need to have as much clarity and confidence in the climate impact of their investments as they do in the traditional financial metrics of profit and loss.”

For business leaders, clearly there’s pressure to step up their organizations’ green efforts and help protect the planet for future generations.",2021
11676,But there’s another pressure being felt.,2021
11677,Leaders in every sector – including financial services – increasingly realize that purpose and profitability are intertwined.,2021
11678,Consumers increasingly expect environmental and societal action from brands they buy and are willing to pay to be greener.,2021
11679,"Businesses are putting ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) standards front and center when negotiating partnerships and supplier deals.",2021
11680,In part due to growing pressure from stakeholders and regulators – with the EU requiring enterprises to regularly report on ESG activities.,2021
11681,But also in response to opportunity: the EU’s Green Deal is mobilizing €1 trillion in investments to support digital initiatives that marry sustainability efforts with economic growth in the coming decade.,2021

11688,"Charles Teschner, the company’s global head of data and analytics noted: “What makes the launch of these new innovative cloud-based products so exciting, is that they have been designed to target our clients’ unmet needs.”

11689,"It’s a real thing that most generations, particularly younger generations, believe in with their heads, hearts and wallets.” – Chris Skinner, financial technology expert

As allocators of capital, financial services companies – whether fintechs, retail banks or investment brokers – have a critical role in shaping a more sustainable, inclusive future.",2021
11690,They are the gatekeepers between finance and the organizations successfully advancing on their ESG goals.,2021
11691,"However, as the ESG market matures, the issue of measurement is proving to be a significant pain point.",2021
11692,"Unlike measuring and reporting financial performance, there is a lack of clear cross-sector standards for ESG reporting.",2021
11693,"Instead, ESG-related data often comes from self-disclosed annual sustainability or quarterly data vendors’ reports and rankings.",2021
