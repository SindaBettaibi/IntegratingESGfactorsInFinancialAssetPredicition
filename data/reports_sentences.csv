1153,"Climate change presents environmental, social, and economic crises on a whole new level.",2021
1154,For nearly two millennia humans have been carbonizing our planet and we need to act together to decarbonize.,2021
1155,"Our first annual sustainability report, released in January 2021, showed early progress on our commitments to become a carbon negative, water positive, zero waste company by 2030 and protect ecosystems by building a Planetary Computer.",2021
1156,"While we continued to make progress on several of our goals, with an overall reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, our Scope 3 emissions increased year over year, due in substantial part to significant global datacenter expansions and the growth in Xbox sales and usage as a result of the pandemic.",2021
1157,"A closer look at 2021 During our most recent fiscal year, we grew business revenue by 20 percent while continuing to reduce our operational emissions, as represented by Scope 1 and 2 combined, with a decrease of approximately 17 percent through our purchasing of renewable energy.",2021
1158,"However, as our business has grown and weve seen increased use of our devices and cloud services, our total Scope 3 emissions (comprising the companys entire value chain) have increased by about 23 percent year-over-year.",2021
1159,"These emissions include, among other things, the carbon emitted from electricity generation to power devices at home or at work and for producing the concrete and steel we use in construction.",2021
1160,"We work to limit these emissions when we design and manufacture our products, and work with our suppliers to report and reduce their emissionsbut still saw an increase.",2021
1161,This serves as an important reminder that Scope 3 emissions are the most difficult to control and reduce.,2021
1162,This year has highlighted the challenges of reducing Scope 3 emissions and were committed to sharing our learnings to help other organizations who are wrestling with these same challenges.,2021
1163,One Scope 3 category that saw an annual increase was capital equipment.,2021
1164,This category includes the emissions to produce equipment we bought this year (and will use for a long time) as well as the carbon emissions associated with the construction of new buildings including both datacenters and office space.,2021
1165,"For example, as the Microsoft Cloud business expands, construction of new datacenters and new server equipment is needed to support growing customer demand.",2021
1166,The emissions associated with the capital equipment category accounted for about 30 percent of our Scope 3 total this year.,2021
1167,"Another Scope 3 category that saw an increase was the use of our products, specifically the estimated emissions associated with powering products we sold including Xbox and Surface devices.",2021
1168,This category accounted for about 29 percent of our Scope 3 total this year.,2021
1169,"Around the world, the electricity used to power devices today largely comes from grids reliant on carbon- intensive sources such as coal or gas, so Microsoft must account for that carbon for the lifetime of our devices to accurately track our Scope 3 emissions.",2021
1170,"And, because every part of the world has a different mix of electricity generation sources, we calculate a devices climate impact based on where the device was sold.",2021
1171,"The journey to net zero Despite these Scope 3 increases, we remain dedicated to building a world better than the one we found, and to helping our customers and partners achieve the same.",2021
1172,"The impact of this work will not all be felt immediately, and our experience this year highlights a few takeaways relevant to many organizations executing against their sustainability commitments.",2021
1173,"we can implement emissions reductions is dependent on many factors that can fluctuate over time, ranging from our own business growth and supplier mix to the rate of growth of green infrastructure, such as the supply of and transition speed to renewable energy.",2021
1174,"Additionally, different sources of emissions will be addressed on different time frames as climate technologies and renewable alternatives advance.",2021
1175,"And as measurement methodologies improve and new standards emerge, companies like ours may see emissions rise or fall year-over-year.",2021
1176,"Nonetheless, the challenge remains: we must continuously improve on our efforts to decouple our emissions from our growth until we reach our carbon negative commitment in 2030.",2021
1177,"Some of this will happen through the completion of specific goals such as our shift to a 100 percent electric campus vehicle fleet, our move away from diesel fuel as a backup energy source for our datacenters, and the carbon benefits of our waste reduction improvements due to our expanding fleet of Circular Centers.",2021
1178,"Other progress will happen through the expansion of our renewable energy purchasing program to cover the energy consumption of our consumer devices, through advances by our suppliers in reducing their own emissions, and through increased purchasing of new materials as they enter the markets, including green steel, low carbon concrete, and other infrastructure components of a future net zero carbon economy.",2021
1179,Foreword (continued) 2. Progress relies on us all counting carbon consistently.,2021
1180,There are several external factors or bugs in the worlds net zero carbon program that if addressed will help us all make greater progress toward our net zero goals.,2021
1181,"The world lacks a common meaning of the term net zero and a common unit of measurement for assessing the climate impact of various net zero approaches, and we must all focus on maturing the markets needed to achieve a net zero carbon economy by 2050.",2021
1182,We explored these topics in greater detail through the lens of our work on carbon removal.,2021
1183,We will continue to innovate and invest to meet our ambitious commitments and well do so in a principled way.,2021
1184,"We will also continue to be transparent about our progress, our challenges, and our learnings to help others on their journey.",2021
1185,"As we look to the future we are committed to: Counting everything, including challenging Scope 3 emissions.",2021
1186,"We are putting programs in place to help lower them, from working with our suppliers to help them decarbonize to continuing to innovate with our company-wide internal carbon tax to incentivize emissions reduction and continuing to invest in carbon removal.",2021
1187,traditional avoided emissions offsets because removal is an underdeveloped and critical tool to solve the worlds climate challenge.,2021
1188,You can only get to net zero when youve reduced all that you can and your remaining carbon emissions are completely balanced by long-term carbon removal.,2021
